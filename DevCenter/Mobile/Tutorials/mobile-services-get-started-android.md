<p>This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an Android app using Windows Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple <em>To do list</em> app that stores app data in the new mobile service.</p>
<p>A screenshot from the completed app is below:</p>

Completing this tutorial requires the [Android SDK], which includes the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE), Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin, and the latest Android platform. Android 4.2 or a later version is required. 

The downloaded quickstart project contains the Mobile Services SDK for Android. While this project requires Android 4.2 or a later version, the Mobile Services SDK requires only Android 2.2 or a later version.

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need a Windows Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes.

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new Android app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Android** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Android app**.

   ![][6]

   This displays the three easy steps to create an Android app connected to your mobile service.

  ![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install the [Android SDK] on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Click **Create TodoItem table** to create a table to store app data.

5. Under **Download and run app**, click **Download**. 

  This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Run your Android app

The final stage of this tutorial is to build and run your new app.

1. Browse to the location where you saved the compressed project files and expand the files on your computer.

2. In Eclipse, click **File** then **Import**, expand **Android**, click **Existing Android Code into Workspace**, and then click **Next.** 

 ![][14]

3. Click **Browse**, browse to the location of the expanded project files, click **OK**, make sure that the TodoActivity project is checked, then click **Finish**. 

 ![][15]

	This imports the project files into the current workspace.

   ![][8]

4. From the **Run** menu, click **Run** to start the project in the Android emulator.

	<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To be able to run the project in the Android emulator, you must define a least one Android Virtual Device (AVD). Use the AVD Manager to create and manage these devices.</p></div>

5. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _Complete the tutorial_, and then click **Add**.

   ![][10]

   This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Windows Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile service, and the data is displayed in the list.

	<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> 
   	<p>You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the ToDoActivity.java file.</p>
 	</div>

6. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItems** table.

   ![][11]

   This lets you browse the data inserted by the app into the table.
