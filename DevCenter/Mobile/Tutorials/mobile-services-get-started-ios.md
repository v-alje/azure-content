<p>This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an iOS app using Windows Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple <em>To do list</em> app that stores app data in the new mobile service.</p>

<h2><span class="short-header">Create a new app</span>Create a new iOS app</h2>

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new iOS app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **iOS** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new iOS app**.

   ![][6]

   This displays the three easy steps to create an iOS app connected to your mobile service.

  ![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Xcode] v4.4 or a later version.

4. Click **Create TodoItems table** to create a table to store app data.

5. Under **Download and run app**, click **Download**. 

  This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service, along with the Mobile Services iOS SDK. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

<h2><span class="short-header">Run your app</span>Run your new iOS app</h2>

The final stage of this tutorial is to build and run your new app.

1. Browse to the location where you saved the compressed project files, expand the files on your computer, and open the project file using Xcode.

   ![][8]

2. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator, which is the default for this project.

3. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _Complete the tutorial_ and then click the plus (**+**) icon.

   ![][10]

   This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Windows Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile service, and the data is displayed in the list.

	<div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
   	<p>You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the TodoService.m file.</p> 
 	</div>

4. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItems** table.

   ![][11]

   This lets you browse the data inserted by the app into the table.
