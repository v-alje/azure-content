<h2><a name="create-client"></a><span class="short-header">Create the Mobile Services Client</span>How to: Create the Mobile Services Client</h2>

The following code instantiates the mobile service client object. 

In your web editor, open the HTML file and add the following to the script references for the page:

	        <script src='//client/MobileServices.Web-1.0.0.min.js'></script>

In the editor, open or create a JavaScript file, and add the following code that defines the `MobileServiceClient` variable, and supply the application URL and application key from the mobile service in the `MobileServiceClient` constructor, in that order. You must replace the placeholder `AppUrl` with the application URL of your mobile service and `AppKey` with the application key. To learn how to obtain the application URL and application key for the mobile service, consult the tutorial [Getting Started with Data in Windows Store JavaScript] or [Getting Started with Data in HTML/JavaScript].

			var MobileServiceClient = WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient;
		    var client = new MobileServiceClient('AppUrl', 'AppKey');

<h2><a name="querying"></a><span class="short-header">Querying data</span>How to: Query data from a mobile service</h2>

All of the code that accesses or modifies data in the SQL Database table calls functions on the `MobileServiceTable` object. You get a reference to the table by calling the `getTable()` function on an instance of the `MobileServiceClient`.
	
		    var todoItemTable = client.getTable('todoitem');



### <a name="filtering"></a>How to: Filter returned data

The following code illustrates how to filter data by including a `where` clause in a query. It returns all items from `todoItemTable` whose complete field is equal to `false`. `todoItemTable` is the reference to the mobile service table that we created previously. The where function applies a row filtering predicate to the query against the table. It accepts as its argument a JSON object or function that defines the row filter, and returns a query that can be further composed. 
	
			var query = todoItemTable.where({
			    complete: false
			}).read().done(function (results) {
			    alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			    alert("Error: " + err);
			});

By adding calling `where` on the Query object and passing an object as a parameter, we are  instructing Mobile Services to return only the rows whose `complete` column contains the `false` value. Also, look at the request URI below, and notice that we are modifying the query string  itself:

			GET /tables/todoitem?$filter=(complete+eq+false) HTTP/1.1			

You can view the URI of the request sent to the mobile service by using message inspection software, such as browser developer tools or Fiddler.

This request would normally be translated roughly into the following SQL query on the server side:
			
			SELECT * 
			FROM TodoItem 			
			WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0

The object which is passed to the `where` method can have an arbitrary number of parameters, and they’ll all be interpreted as AND clauses to the query. For example, the line below:

			query.where({
			   complete: false,
			   assignee: "david",
			   difficulty: "medium"
			}).read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

Would be roughly translated (for the same request shown before) as
			
			SELECT * 
			FROM TodoItem 
			WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0
			      AND assignee = 'david'
			      AND difficulty = 'medium'

The `where` statement above and the SQL query above find incomplete items assigned to "david" of "medium" difficulty.

There is, however, another way to write the same query. A `.where` call on the Query object will add an `AND` expression to the `WHERE` clause, so we could have written that in three lines instead:

			query.where({
			   complete: false
			});
			query.where({
			   assignee: "david"
			});
			query.where({
			   difficulty: "medium"
			});

Or using the fluent API:

			query.where({
			   complete: false
			})
			   .where({
			   assignee: "david"
			})
			   .where({
			   difficulty: "medium"
			});

The two methods are equivalent and may be used interchangeably. All the `where` calls so far take an object with some parameters, and are compared for equality against the data from the database. There is, however, another overload for the query method, which takes a function instead of the object. In this function we can then write more complex expressions, using operators such as inequality and other relational operations. In these functions, the keyword `this` binds to the server object.

The body of the function is translated into an OData boolean expression which is passed to a query string parameter. It is possible to pass in a function that takes no parameters, like so:

		    query.where(function () {
		       return this.assignee == "david" && (this.difficulty == "medium" || this.difficulty == "low");
		    }).read().done(function (results) {
		       alert(JSON.stringify(results));
		    }, function (err) {
		       alert("Error: " + err);
		    });


If passing in a function with parameters, any arguments after the `where` clause are bound to the function parameters in order. Any objects which come from the outside of the function scope MUST be passed as parameters – the function cannot capture any external variables. In the next two examples, the argument "david" is bound to the parameter `name` and in the first example, the argument "medium" is also bound to the parameter `level`. Also, the function must consist of a single `return` statement with a supported expression, like so:
					
			 query.where(function (name, level) {
			    return this.assignee == name && this.difficulty == level;
			 }, "david", "medium").read().done(function (results) {
			    alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			 }, function (err) {
			    alert("Error: " + err);
			 });

So, as long as we follow the rules, we can add more complex filters to our database queries, like so:

		    query.where(function (name) {
		       return this.assignee == name &&
		          (this.difficulty == "medium" || this.difficulty == "low");
		    }, "david").read().done(function (results) {
		       alert(JSON.stringify(results));
		    }, function (err) {
		       alert("Error: " + err);
		    });

It is possible to combine `where` with `orderBy`, `take`, and `skip`. See the next section for details.

### <a name="sorting"></a>How to: Sort returned data

The following code illustrates how to sort data by including an `orderBy` or `orderByDescending` function in the query. It returns items from `todoItemTable` sorted ascending by the `text` field. By default, the server returns only the first 50 elements. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>A server-driven page size us used by default to prevent all elements from being returned. This keeps default requests for large data sets from negatively impacting the service. </p> </div>
>
You may increase the number of items to be returned by calling `take` as described in the next section. `todoItemTable` is the reference to the mobile service table that we created previously.

			var ascendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderBy("text").read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

			var descendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderByDescending("text").read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

			var descendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderBy("text").orderByDescending("text").read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

### <a name="paging"></a>How to: Return data in pages

The following code shows how to implement paging in returned data by using the `take` and `skip` clauses in the query.  The following query, when executed, returns the top three items in the table. 

			var query = todoItemTable.take(3).read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

Notice that the `take(3)` method was translated into the query option `$top=3` in the query URI.

The following revised query skips the first three results and returns the next three after that. This is effectively the second "page" of data, where the page size is three items.

			var query = todoItemTable.skip(3).take(3).read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

Again, you can view the URI of the request sent to the mobile service. Notice that the `skip(3)` method was translated into the query option `$skip=3` in the query URI.

This is a simplified scenario of passing hard-coded paging values to the `take` and `skip` functions. In a real-world app, you can use queries similar to the above with a pager control or comparable UI to let users navigate to previous and next pages. 

### <a name="selecting"></a>How to: Select specific columns

You can specify which set of properties to include in the results by adding a `select` clause to your query. For example, the following code returns the `id`, `complete`, and `text` properties from each row in the `todoItemTable`:

			var query = todoItemTable.select("id", "complete", "text").read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			})
	
Here the parameters to the select function are the names of the table's columns that you want to return. 


All the functions described so far are additive, so we can just keep calling them and we’ll each time affect more of the query. One more example:


		    query.where({
		       complete: false
		    })
		       .select('id', 'assignee')
		       .orderBy('assignee')
		       .take(10)
		       .read().done(function (results) {
		       alert(JSON.stringify(results));
		    }, function (err) {
		       alert("Error: " + err);

### <a name="lookingup"></a>How to: Look up data by ID

The `lookup` function takes only the `id` value, and returns the object from the database with that ID.

			todoItemTable.lookup(3).done(function (result) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(result));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			})

<h2><a name="inserting"></a><span class="short-header">Inserting data</span>How to: Insert data into a mobile service</h2>

The following code illustrates how to insert new rows into a table. The client requests that a row of data be inserted by sending a POST request to the mobile service. The request body contains the data to be inserted, as a JSON object. 

			todoItemTable.insert({
			   text: "New Item",
			   complete: false
			})

This inserts data from the supplied JSON object into the table. You can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the insertion is complete:

			todoItemTable.insert({
			   text: "New Item",
			   complete: false
			}).done(function (result) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(result));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

<h2><a name="modifying"></a><span class="short-header">Modifying data</span>How to: Modify data in a mobile service</h2>

The following code illustrates how to update data in a table. The client requests that a row of data be updated by sending a PATCH request to the mobile service. The request body contains the specific fields to be updated, as a JSON object. It updates an existing item in the table `todoItemTable`. 

			todoItemTable.update({
			   id: idToUpdate,
			   text: newText
			})

The first parameter specifies the instance to update in the table, as specified by its ID. 

You can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the update is complete:

			todoItemTable.update({
			   id: idToUpdate,
			   text: newText
			}).done(function (result) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(result));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});
	
<h2><a name="deleting"></a><span class="short-header">Deleting data</span>How to: Delete data in a mobile service</h2>

The following code illustrates how to delete data from a table. The client requests that a row of data be deleted by sending a DELETE request to the mobile service. It deletes an existing item in the table todoItemTable. 

			todoItemTable.del({
			   id: idToDelete
			})

The first parameter specifies the instance to delete in the table, as specified by its ID. 

You can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the delete is complete:	
	
			todoItemTable.del({
			   id: idToDelete
			}).done(function () {
			   /* Do something */
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});	

<h2><a name="binding"></a><span class="short-header">Displaying data</span>How to: Display data in the user interface</h2>

This section shows how to display returned data objects using UI elements. To query items in `todoItemTable` and display it in a very simple list, you can run the following example code. No selection, filtering or sorting of any kind is done. 

			var query = todoItemTable;
		
			query.read().then(function (todoItems) {
			   // The space specified by 'placeToInsert' is an unordered list element <ul> ... </ul>
			   var listOfItems = document.getElementById('placeToInsert');
			   for (var i = 0; i < todoItems.length; i++) {
			      var li = document.createElement('li');
			      var div = document.createElement('div');
			      div.innerText = todoItems[i].text;
			      li.appendChild(div);
			      listOfItems.appendChild(li);
			   }
			}).read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

In a Windows Store app, the results of a query can be used to create a [WinJS.Binding.List] object, which can be bound as the data source for a [ListView] object. For more information, see [Data binding (Windows Store apps using JavaScript and HTML)].

<h2><a name="caching"></a><span class="short-header">Authentication</span>How to: Authenticate users</h2>

Mobile Services supports authenticating and authorizing app users using a variety of external identity providers: Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter. You can set permissions on tables to restrict access for specific operations to only authenticated users. You can also use the identity of authenticated users to implement authorization rules in server scripts. For more information, see the [Get started with authentication] tutorial.

Two authentication flows are supported: a "server" flow and a "client" flow. The server flow provides the simplest authentication experience, as it relies on the provider’s web authentication interface. The client flow allows for deeper integration with device-specific capabilities such as single-sign-on as it relies on provider-specific device-specific SDKs.

<h3>Server flow</h3>
To login with Facebook, use the following code. If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value passed to the `login` method above to one of the following: `microsoftaccount`, `facebook`, `twitter`, or `google`.

		client.login("facebook").done(function (results) {
		     alert("You are now logged in as: " + results.userId);
		}, function (err) {
		     alert("Error: " + err);
		});

Inside your mobile service, you need to configure the application ID and secret provided by your authentication provider. For more details, see the [Get started with authentication] tutorial.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>When you register the package information from a Windows Store app with Mobile Services, the client is able to re-use login credentials for a single sign-on experience. After the package information is registered with Mobile Services, you can call the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj554236.aspx" target="_blank">login</a> method by supplying a value of <strong>true</strong> for the <i>useSingleSignOn</i> parameter. If you do not do this, your Windows Store app users will be presented with a login prompt every time that the login method is called. For information on how to register your app package, see the tutorial <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-push-js/">Get started with push notifications</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Client flow</h3>

In this example we use the Live SDK, which supports single-sign-on for Windows Store apps. [You can see a full example of how to set up this scenario here]. In the most simplified form, we can use the client flow as shown in this snippet:

		WL.login({ scope: "wl.basic"}).then(function (result) {
		      client.login(
		            "microsoftaccount", 
		            {"authenticationToken": result.session.authentication_token})
		      .done(function(results){
		            alert("You are now logged in as: " + results.userId);
		      },
		      function(error){
		            alert("Error: " + err);
		      });
		});

In case you are using any of the other authentication providers (Facebook or Google, Twitter is not supported at this point), the example changes slightly. Let’s assume the token provided by the respective auth provider SDK is stored in the variable `token`.

		client.login(
		     "facebook", 
		     {"access_token": token})
		.done(function (results) {
		     alert("You are now logged in as: " + results.userId);
		}, function (err) {
		     alert("Error: " + err);
		});

<h3>Caching the authentication token</h3>
In some cases, the call to the login method can be avoided after the first time the user authenticates. We can use [sessionStorage] or [localStorage] to cache the current user identity the first time they log in and every subsequent time we check whether we already have the user identity in our cache. If the cache is empty or calls fail (meaning the current login session has expired), we still need to go through the login process. 

        // After logging in
        sessionStorage.loggedInUser = JSON.stringify(client.currentUser);

        // Log in 
        if (sessionStorage.loggedInUser) {
           client.currentUser = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.loggedInUser);
        } else {
           // Regular login flow
       }

         // Log out
        client.logout();
        sessionStorage.loggedInUser = null;


<h2><a name="errors"></a><span class="short-header">Error handling</span>How to: Handle errors</h2>

There are several ways to encounter, validate, and work around errors in Mobile Services. 

As an example, server scripts are registered in a mobile service and can be used to perform a wide range of operations on data being inserted and updated, including validation and data modification. Imagine defining and registering a server script that validate and modify data, like so:

			function insert(item, user, request) {
			   if (item.text.length > 10) {
				  request.respond(statusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, { error: "Text cannot exceed 10 characters" });
			   } else {
			      request.execute();
			   }
			}

This server-side script validates the length of string data sent to the mobile service and rejects strings that are too long, in this case longer than 10 characters.

Now that the mobile service is validating data and sending error responses on the server-side, you can update your HTML app to be able to handle error responses from validation.

		todoItemTable.insert({
		   text: itemText,
		   complete: false
		})
		   .then(function (results) {
		   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
		}, function (error) {
		   alert(JSON.parse(error.request.responseText).error);
		});


To tease this out even further, you pass in the error handler as the second argument each time you perform data access: 
			
			function handleError(message) {
			   if (window.console && window.console.error) {
			      window.console.error(message);
			   }
			}

			client.getTable("tablename").read().then(function (data) { /* do something */ }, handleError);

<h2><a name="promises"></a><span class="short-header">Promises</span>How to: Use promises</h2>

Promises provide a mechanism to schedule work to be done on a value that has not yet been computed. It is an abstraction for managing interactions with asynchronous APIs. 

The `done` promise is executed as soon as the function provided to it has either successfully completed or has gotten an error. Unlike the `then` promise, it is guaranteed to throw any error that is not handled inside the function, and after the handlers have finished executing, this function throws any error that would have been returned from then as a promise in the error state. For more information, see [done].

			promise.done(onComplete, onError);

Like so:
	
			var query = todoItemTable;
			query.read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

The `then` promise is the same as the as the `done` promise, but unlike the `then` promise, `done` is guaranteed to throw any error that is not handled inside the function. If you do not provide an error handler to `then` and the operation has an error, it does not throw an exception but rather returns a promise in the error state. For more information, see [then].

			promise.then(onComplete, onError).done( /* Your success and error handlers */ );

Like so:

			var query = todoItemTable;
			query.read().done(function (results) {
			   alert(JSON.stringify(results));
			}, function (err) {
			   alert("Error: " + err);
			});

You can use promises in a number of different ways. You can chain promise operations by calling `then` or `done` on the promise that is returned by the previous `then` function. Use `then` for an intermediate stage of the operation (for example `.then().then()`), and `done` for the final stage of the operation (for example `.then().then().done()`).  You can chain multiple `then` functions, because `then` returns a promise. You cannot chain more than one `done` method, because it returns undefined. [Learn more about the  differences between then and done].
	
 			todoItemTable.insert({
 			   text: ’foo’
 			}).then(function (inserted) {
 			   inserted.newField = 123;
 			   return todoItemTable.update(inserted);
 			}).done(function (insertedAndUpdated) {
 			   alert(JSON.stringify(insertedAndUpdated));
 			})

<h2><a name="customizing"></a><span class="short-header">Customize request headers</span>How to: Customize client request headers</h2>

You can send custom request headers using the `withFilter` function, reading and writing arbitrary properties of the request about to be sent within the filter. You may want to add such a custom HTTP header if a server-side script needs it or may be enhanced by it. 

			var client = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://your-app-url', 'your-key')
			   .withFilter(function (request, next, callback) {
			   request.headers.MyCustomHttpHeader = "Some value";
			   next(request, callback);
			});

Filters are used for a lot more than customizing request headers. They can be used to examine or change requests, examine or change  responses, bypass networking calls, send multiple calls, etc.

<h2><a name="hostnames"></a><span class="short-header">Use CORS</span>How to: Use cross-origin resource sharing</h2>

To control which web sites are allowed to interact with and send requests to your mobile service, make sure to add the host name of the website you use to host it to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist using the Configure tab. You can use wildcards if required. By default, new Mobile Services instruct browsers to permit access only from `localhost`, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows JavaScript code running in a browser on an external hostname to interact with your Mobile Service.  This configuration is not necessary for WinJS applications.
