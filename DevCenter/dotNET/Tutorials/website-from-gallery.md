# Create an Orchard CMS web site from the gallery in Windows Azure

The gallery makes available a wide range of popular web applications developed by Microsoft, third party companies, and open source software initiatives. Web applications created from the gallery do not require installation of any software other than the browser used to connect to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com). 

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to create a new site from the gallery

- How to launch and manage your site from the Management Portal
 
You'll build an Orchard CMS site that uses a default template. [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) is a free, open-source, .NET-based CMS application that allows you to create customized, content-driven web sites. Orchard CMS includes an extensibility framework through which you can [download additional modules and themes](http://gallery.orchardproject.net/) to customize your site. The following illustration shows the Orchard CMS site that you will create.
