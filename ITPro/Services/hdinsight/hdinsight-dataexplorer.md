#How to Connect Excel to Windows Azure HDInsight with Power Query

One key feature of Microsoftâ€™s Big Data Solution is the integration of  Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) components with Apache Hadoop clusters that have been deployed by the Windows Azure HDInsight Service. A primary example of this integration is the ability to connect Excel to the Azure storage account that stores the data assocoiated with your HDInsight cluster by using Power Query for Excel. This topic walks you through how to set up and use Power Query from Excel to query data associated with an Hodoop in an HDInsight. There are two parts to this procedure:

1. [Install Microsoft Power Query for Excel](#InstallPowerQuery)
2. [Import data into Excel](#ImportData)

**Prerequisites**:

* You have installed Excel 2010 or Excel 2013.
* You have a Windows Azure Account and have enabled the HDInsight Service for your subscription. For instructions on how to do this, see [Getting Started with Windows Azure HDInsight Service][getting-started]

Power Query can be used to import data from a variety of sources into into Microsoft Excel, where it can be examined with Business Intelligence (BI) tools. In particular, Power Query can import data that has been output or that is associated with an HDInsight cluster.

1. Download the Power Query from from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379)and install it.

2. Open up Excel, select the **Power Query** tab, select the **From Other Sources** option, and then From Windows Azure item.

3. Enter the name of the Azure Blob Storage Account associated with your cluster and click **OK**.

4. Enter the account key for the Azure Storage Account in the Access Windows Azure HDInsight wizard and click **Save**. If you need to retrieve your key, return to the Windows Azure Portal, select your storage account, and click on the Manage Access Key icon on the bottom of the page. Click on the copy icon  to the right of the primary key and paste the value into the wizard.

HDInsight ships with a default Hive table that will be used here to illustrate how data can be imported into Excel using the Power Query.

1. In the **Query Editor**, select your cluster in the Navigator and then find and select the default HiveSampleData.txt file and click **Done**.

2. The query then imports the Hive Table into Excel.

##Summary

The Power Query add-in for Excel makes it easy to import data from your HDInsight Service cluster into Excel where Business Intelligence tools such as Power Pivot and Power Map may be used to inspect, analyze, and present the data.

## Next steps

In this article you learned how to use Power Query to retrieve data from the HDInsight Service into Excel. Similarly, you can retrieve data from the HDInsight Service into SQL Azure. It is also possible to upload data into an HDInsight Service.

* For information on using Sqoop to copy data from an HDInsight Service to SQL Azure, see [Using HDInsight to process Blob Storage data and write the results to a SQL Database][blob-hdi-sql]. 

* For information on using Sqoop or Windows Azure Blob Storage to load data into an HDInsight Service, see [How to Upload Data to the HDInsight Service][upload-data].
