# BizTalk Services: Throttling

Windows Azure BizTalk Services implements Service throttling based on two conditions: memory usage and the number of simultaneous messages processing. This topic lists the throttling thresholds and describes the Runtime behavior when a throttling condition occurs.


## Throttling Thresholds

The following table lists the throttling source and thresholds:


<table border="1">

<tr bgcolor="FAF9F9">
        <td>-</td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Low Threshold</strong></td>
        <td><strong>High Threshold</strong></td>
</tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Memory</td>
        <td>% of total system memory available/PageFileBytes. 
<br/><br/>
Total available PageFileBytes is approximately 2 times the RAM of the system.</td>
        <td>60%</td>
        <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Message Processing</td>
        <td>Number of messages processing simultaneously</td>
        <td>40 * number of cores</td>
        <td>100 * number of cores</td>
    </tr>
</table>

When a high threshold is reached, Windows Azure BizTalk Services starts to throttle. Throttling stops when the low threshold is reached. For example, your service is using 65% system memory. In this situation, the service does not throttle. Your service starts using 70% system memory. In this situation, the service throttles and continues to throttle until the service uses 60% (low threshold) system memory.

Windows Azure BizTalk Services tracks the throttling status (normal state vs. throttled state) and the throttling duration.


## Runtime Behavior

When Azure BizTalk Services enters a throttling state, the following occurs:

- Throttling is per role instance. For example:<br/>
RoleInstanceA is throttling. RoleInstanceB is not throttling. In this situation, messages in RoleInstanceB are processed as expected. Messages in RoleInstanceA are discarded and fail with the following error:<br/><br/>
Server is busy. Please try again.<br/><br/>
- Any pull sources do not poll or download a message. For example:<br/>
A pipeline pulls messages from an external FTP source. The role instance doing the pull gets into a throttling state. In this situation, the pipeline stops downloading additional messages until the role instance stops throttling.
- A response is sent to the client so the client can resubmit the message.
- You must wait until the throttling is resolved. Specifically, you must wait until the low threshold is reached.

### Important notes
- Throttling cannot be disabled.
- Throttling thresholds cannot be modified.
- Throttling is implemented system-wide.
