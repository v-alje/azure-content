# Understanding Cloud Storage

This article describes the Windows Azure data storage offerings: Blobs,
Tables, and SQL Database. These offerings are hosted in Windows Azure data
centers and are available to your applications whether they are running
on-premises, hosted within a Windows Azure data center, or hosted within
a competing cloud service. The data storage offerings offer many
benefits, including high availability, scalability, fault tolerance,
geo-replication, easy manageability, limitless storage, and security. In
addition, the data is accessible via the Internet to any operating
system (OS) and programming language.

If you are running your application code in a Windows Azure data center,
then the virtual machine (VM) that is hosting your application exposes
two additional storage options called local storage and Windows Azure
drives. These storage options will be discussed at the end of this
article. <a id="compare" name="compare"></a>

## Storing Data in Windows Azure

In this section, we’ll discuss how storing your data centrally, outside
of machines running your code, lets you produce highly-available and
scalable applications. We’ll also describe how you can leverage the
Windows Azure data storage offerings to assist you when creating highly
available and scalable applications.

Imagine your application is running on a machine in which a hardware
failure occurs. The hardware failure would make your application not
accessible to client requests. If your application is hosted in Windows
Azure, Windows Azure detects the hardware failure and automatically
moves your application code to a new machine so that your application
remains available to clients. However, Windows Azure does not move any
data from one machine to another. In fact, it would be impossible to
move the data if the hardware failure was due to a hard disk crash.
Storing your data outside the actual machine allows the new machine to
access it.

In addition, you may want to increase or decrease the number of machines
running your application code in order to handle the actual load being
placed on your application by client requests. If you have multiple
machines running the code then multiple client requests from a single
client could be directed to different machines. In order to keep data
for a single client accessible to multiple machines, your application
has to keep the client’s data in a central repository accessible to all
the machines running your application code.

The figure below shows how client requests could be distributed to
different machines all of which have access the same data storage.

![image][img0]

For example, let’s say that your application allows a client to place
items into a shopping cart and later, the client purchases the items
they previously put into their cart. In this example, the client’s
request to add an item to the shopping cart could occur on one machine
and the request to checkout could be directed to a different machine.
The second machine would need to know the items in the client’s cart.

In order to achieve highly available and scalable applications, Windows
Azure offers multitenant storage machines within the
various Windows Azure data centers. These machines replicate your data
ensuring that if one replica fails, others are still viable. These
storage offerings can be accessed by applications running in a Windows
Azure data center and can also be accessed directly by applications
running on-premises or hosted in another cloud service.

The figure above shows Blobs, Tables, and SQL Database as the central data
repository. To store data in any of these offerings, you must first
select which of the Windows Azure data centers you want to house your
data. The table below shows the locations of 6 Windows Azure data
centers throughout the globe:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 2px solid #000000;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px;">
**Country/Region**

</td>
<td style="width: 200px;">
**Sub-regions**

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Europe

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>
<td>
Southeast & East

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Normally, you select a sub-region close to the clients that access your
data in order to reduce latency thereby improving performance. In
addition, you would select a sub-region that meets any jurisdiction
issues relevant to your data. The data you store is replicated three
times within this sub-region in order to you give you a high degree of
fault tolerance. In addition, since the data is replicated, it can be
served from multiple machines simultaneously thus increasing the
performance of accessing your data. In fact, the data storage service
constantly monitors the load on its machines and automatically load
balances your data across its servers to maintain a high degree of
throughput.

Furthermore, Blobs and Tables are, by default, replicated to the other
sub-region providing you with a high degree of disaster recovery. For
example, if you select the United States North Central sub-region to
house your data, then your data will be replicated in this sub-region
and will also be replicated in the United States South Central
sub-region as well. Should the North Central data center experience a
disaster, then your data will automatically start being served from the
South Central data center. If you choose, you can opt out of
geo-replication by telephoning Windows Azure support.

When using Blobs, Tables, or SQL Database, the data can be encrypted as it
goes over the wire. However, the data is stored unencrypted inside the
Windows Azure data centers. In many cases, you can encrypt the data
yourself before sending it over the wire; Windows Azure will simply store
whatever you send it and now the data will be stored encrypted. The
Windows Azure SDK includes a storage emulator which you can use on your
local machine to test your code’s use of Blobs and Tables. The emulator
is free of charge to use and requires the use of SQL Server or SQL
Express. You can test your code’s use of SQL Database by having it work
against a locally installed instance of SQL Server or SQL Express.

The pricing for Blobs and Tables is related to the storage you consume,
the number of bytes you transfer out of the data center (transfer into
the data center is free) and the number of I/O operations you perform.
The pricing for SQL Database is based on the size of each database and the
number of bytes you transfer out of the data center. To understand the
latest pricing of these various storage mechanisms, please see [Windows
Azure Pricing].

## Windows Azure Blobs and Tables

Blobs and Tables reside within a Windows Azure Storage account. A single
Windows Azure Storage account can hold up to 100 TB of data. If you need
to store more data, then you can create additional storage accounts.
Within a storage account, you can store data in Blobs and Tables. A
storage account can also contain Queues. Here is a brief description for
Blobs and Tables (they are described in more detail in the following
sections):

-   **Blobs (Binary Large Objects)**. Blobs are for storing individual
    data items (like files) which can be large in size. A single Blob
    typically contains a document (xml, docx, pptx, xlxs, pdf, etc.), a
    picture, a song or a video. Blobs can be publicly exposed for
    read-only access and retrieved via HTTP(S) URLs.

-   **Tables**. Tables contain large collections of property-bag state
    (called entities) such as customer information, order data, news
    feed items. Tables sort their entities and can return a filtered
    subset of the entities.

These abstractions are accessible via [HTTP(S) REST APIs][] (overs ports
80 and 443) making them available to all operating systems and all
programming languages. To simplify making the web requests for software
developers, you can use several *client libraries* targeting specific
operating systems and programming languages. Libraries exist for .NET,
Node.js, Java, and PHP, and are available at the [Windows Azure web site][]. The term “client libraries” is used since your application
is a client to the data storage servers. The figure below shows how your
application code makes a call into a client library which, in turn,
makes an HTTP(S) REST request to Blobs or Tables.

![image][img1]

When you create a storage account, your account is assigned two 256-bit
account keys. One of these two keys must be specified in a header that
is part of the HTTP(S) request. Having two keys allows for key rotation
in order to maintain good security on your data. Typically, your
applications would use one of the keys to access your data. Then, after
a period of time (determined by you), you have your applications switch
over to using the second key. Once you know your applications are using
the second key, you retire the first key and then generate a new key.
Using the two keys this way allows your applications access to the data
without incurring any downtime.

<a name="blobs"> </a>

## Blobs<a id="Blob" name="Blob"></a>

Blobs provide a way to store large amounts of unstructured, binary data,
such as documents, pictures, audio, video, etc. In fact, one of the
features of Blobs is streaming content such as audio or video. A storage
account has blob containers and a container contains blobs. Containers
are similar to directories and contain blobs. There are two kinds of
Blobs:

-   **Block Blobs** are ideal for most scenarios and allow you to easily
    insert, delete, and reorder blocks within a blob. Each block is
    identified with an ID and contains up to 4MB of data. The maximum
    size of a Block Blob is 200GB.

-   **Page Blobs** are typically used for virtual hard drives (VHDs) and
    are much less commonly used than Block Blobs. Page Blobs allow you
    to save money when blobs contain long runs of zeros and have better
    performance for random write operations. A Page Blob is composed of
    512-byte pages. Any page that you do not write to logically contains
    zeros and is not physically backed by storage and therefore you are
    not charged for these pages. The maximum size of a Page Blob is 1TB.

There are many features available to you when using Blobs. The list
below enumerates some of them:

-   Blobs can be accessed via HTTP(S) REST APIs or via a client library

-   Blobs can be exposed for read-only public access which makes them
    great for storing public pictures, videos, etc.

-   You can create a Shared Access Signature (SAS) for a blob allowing
    others that do not have one of the 256-bit storage access keys to
    read, write, or delete the blob during a specified window of time.

-   You can create snapshots of a blob effectively making read-only
    versions. This is useful for maintaining different versions of a
    document, photo, or video.

-   An application can acquire a lease on a blob allowing it to make
    multiple exclusive updates to the blob.

-   You can use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and deliver
    blobs from data centers that are closer to your customers thereby
    improving performance. The CDN also offers smooth streaming support
    for blob videos.

To ease the migration of existing applications that use standard File
I/O APIs to access files, Windows Azure offers a feature called Windows
Azure Drives. This feature effectively mounts a VHD stored as a Page
Blob as a disk drive. This allows your application code to use standard
FILE I/O APIs against the mounted drive letter and redirect the I/O
operations to the backing blob. This feature is only available to
applications running in Windows Azure because the VMs must have a
special NTFS device driver installed on them. See [Windows Azure Drives][] for more details.<a id="Queue" name="Queue"></a>

<a name="tables"> </a>

## Tables

Tables provide a non-relational key/property bag collection useful for
storing tabular data such as customer information, orders, news feeds,
and game scores. Key benefits of tables are that they are
pay-for-consumption, can handle small and large (100 TB) amounts of data
efficiently, and are accessible via HTTP(S). For data that requires
server-side computation such as joins, sorts, views, and stored
procedures, you should consider using SQL Database as Tables do not support
these features. See [SQL Database](#sql) for more details.

A table contains entities. Unlike database tables, the entities within a
single table can have differing sets of properties. For example, you can
store customer entities and order entities within the same table. Tables
are similar to rows within a spreadsheet application (such as Excel) in
that each row can contain a different number of columns and the cells
can vary their data type.

An entity can be up to 1MB in size and consist of a set of up to 255
tuples. Each tuple represents a property with its name, data type, and
value. The set of valid data types are shown below:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 2px solid #000000;">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
As you can see, all entities must have the following three tuples (the
remaining 252 are determined by you):

-   Timestamp: a DateTime

-   PartitionKey: a 1KB String

-   RowKey: a 1KB String

The timestamp value is always assigned by the Windows Azure; you do not
have control over this value. Whenever an entity is added or updated,
Windows Azure assigns the current time to the property. This property is
used for versioning and optimistic concurrency scenarios.

The PartitonKey and RowKey together must uniquely identify a single
entity within a table. That is, you cannot have two entities with
identical PartitionKey and RowKey values inside a single table. What you
choose to use for a PartitionKey is critically important when you’re
designing a table because the PartitionKey value controls several things
which are often in conflict with each other. Specifically, the
PartitionKey controls:

-   **Entity Sort Order**. Within a table, entities are sorted in order
    of their PartitionKey value. Entities that share the same
    PartitionKey value are sorted by the RowKey value.

-   **Entity Partitioning**. The Windows Azure Table Service can serve
    different partitions from different machines. So, the value you
    chose for the PartitionKey determines the scalability of accessing
    entities within your table. If all entities have the same
    PartitionKey value, then the service cannot serve some entity
    requests from 1 machine and some entity request from another
    machine. Queries for entities within a single partition are faster
    than queries that span partitions.

-   **Entity Group Transactions**. Tables allow multiple entities to be
    updated as a single atomic transaction; this is called an *Entity
    Group Transaction (EGT)*. However, an EGT is allowed only for
    entities that share the same PartitionKey value because all these
    entities are guaranteed to be served from a single machine. EGTs are
    the main reason to allow entities with different schemas to exist in
    a single table. For example, using an EGT, you can update a customer
    and all their orders as a single atomic transaction.

Table storage supports basic create, read (with filtering), update, &
delete (CRUD) operations and these operations are performed using OData
over HTTP(S) REST APIs. But, unlike database tables, it does not support
joins, foreign keys, stored procedures, triggers, or any processing
(other than filtering) on the storage engine side. Features like these
are supported by SQL Database, described in the next section. Queries
returning a large number of results, or queries that take more than 5
seconds return partial results along with a *continuation token*. You
can process the results returned and then pass the *continuation token*
back to the service to get the next set of
results.<a id="Table" name="Table"></a>

<a name="sql"> </a>

## SQL Database

SQL Database provides a highly-available and scalable relational database
management system for Windows Azure. Key benefits of SQL Database are SQL
Server compatibility which allows you to use familiar T-SQL, SQL library
APIs, tools, etc. For example, ADO.NET and ODBC continue to work with
SQL Database with minimal code changes. For data that requires server-side
computation such as joins, sorts, views, and stored procedures, SQL
Database is an ideal choice. Alternatively, if you do not need these
features, then [Windows Azure Tables][] may be a better option.

SQL Database is a multitenant service which maintains scalability by
automatically moving databases from heavily accessed machines to other
machines. You access the database using the Tabular Data Stream (TDS)
protocol on port 1433; In addition, access is granted from specific IP
ranges and a password. Like Blobs & Tables, SQL Database can also be
accessed via applications running on-premises, inside a Windows Azure
data center or via some other cloud service.

The figure below shows how your application code makes a call into a SQL
client library (such as ADO.NET) which, in turn, makes a TDS request
over TCP to SQL Database.

![image][img3] <a id="SQLAzure" name="SQLAzure"> </a>

Since Windows Azure does not provide direct access to the underlying
hardware, administration tasks that involve hardware access, such as
defining where the database file is located, are inaccessible in SQL
Azure. Physical administration tasks are handled automatically by the
platform, though you must still perform logical administration tasks
such as creating logins, users, roles, etc. Because you cannot directly
access the hardware, there are some differences between SQL Server and
SQL Database in terms of administration, provisioning, T-SQL support,
programming model and features.

Unlike the other storage offerings discussed so-far, SQL Database provides
more than simple data storage; it also provides server side processing,
which allows you to perform complex processing on stored data without
having to retrieve and process the entire data set within your
application. For example, a query to find all salesmen with sales
greater than $1,000.00 in the past year, within a specific region of the
country, and provide a sum total of all their sales, can be executed
completely by SQL Database and the results returned to your application.

A SQL Database instance can be up to 150GB in size and can contain multiple
tables with complex relationships between data in the tables. Rows can
be up to 8MB in size, and can contain 1024 columns. A table within SQL
Azure can have one clustered index on any column, and up to 999
secondary indexes.

<a name="additional"> </a>

## Additional Storage Options for Applications Hosted in Windows Azure

When your application is running in Windows Azure, the VMs running your
application code have access to local storage and can also leverage
Windows Azure Drives. The next two sections explain these storage
mechanisms.

<a name="local"> </a>

## Local Storage

When you run your application in Windows Azure, it is hosted in VMs.
Each VM has a virtual hard drive connected to it and you can access
subdirectories contained on this drive. The subdirectories provide fast,
temporary storage for your application instance. In your code, you use
standard file I/O operations (such as .NET’s FileStream class) to store
any data you choose in these subdirectories.

The subdirectories are only accessible by the code running on the VM and
can be configured to persist or be erased whenever the VM reboots.
However, if Windows Azure moves your code to another machine due to
hardware failure or maintenance, be aware that the data in the
subdirectories will not be moved with your code; the data will be lost.
For this reason, local storage is best thought of as a cache allowing
fast access to frequently-used data. Local storage is also useful for
building up data (such as logs) that is then frequently transferred to a
more durable storage mechanism such as Blobs, Tables, or SQL Database.
<a id="Different" name="Different"></a>Consuming and accessing local
storage is completely free.

Each local storage subdirectory can hold between 1MB and the maximum
amount allowed by the VM size that you have configured for your service.
The table below shows the available VM sizes and the maximum amount of
disk space available across all the local storage subdirectories on the
VM:

## Windows Azure Drives

Windows Azure Drives provides enables existing applications to run in
Windows Azure with minimal code changes by providing a hard disk that is
backed by a blob.

A lot of existing applications use normal file system APIs to store data
on the local hard drive. However, as pointed out at the beginning of
this article, local storage is not accessible to other machines and
therefore prohibits the creating of highly-available applications. A
Windows Azure Drive allows you to create a virtual hard drive (VHD)
backed by a Page Blob and mount that drive into the VM running your
application code. You can create a VHD on your computer and then upload
it to blob storage or you can use the REST API to have Windows Azure
create the blob.

Once in Blob storage, your application code can mount the VHD into your
application’s VM. The VM has a special file system device driver on it
that accepts normal file system I/O requests and translates them into
operations on the blob-backed VHD. If the machine fails, then another
machine can run the same code and mount the VHD accessing the data that
was saved previously. Note that only one machine at a time can mount a
Windows Azure Drive for writing which is why this feature is not for
applications that are scaling out with multiple instances. However, it
is possible to mount a read-only (snapshot) version of the blob into
multiple VMs simultaneously. This can make Windows Azure Drives useful
if you have a lot of read-only static content (like static HTML
files).<a id="Ref" name="Ref"></a>
