###[How to Create a Custom Virtual Machine](/en-us/manage/linux/common-tasks/upload-a-VHD/)

Learn how to create a custom virtual machine by providing advanced options, such as size, connected resources, DNS name, and network connection. You use this option if you want to connect virtual machines or if you want to use a custom image to create the machine.
 
###[How to Set Up Communication with a Virtual Machine](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/setup-endpoints/)
 
Learn how to set up communication between virtual machines. All virtual machines that you create in Windows Azure can automatically communicate using a private network channel with other virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network. 

###[How to Capture an Image of a Virtual Machine Running Linux](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/capture-an-image/)
 
Learn how to use images from the Image Gallery to easily create virtual machines, or to capture and use your own images to create customized virtual machines. If you want to create multiple virtual machines that are set up the same way, you can capture an image of a configured virtual machine and use that image as a template.

###[How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Linux](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/log-on-a-linux-vm/)
Learn how to install and use a Secure Shell (SSH) client to logon to a virtual machine that is running the Linux operating system. 

###[How to Connect Virtual Machines in a Cloud Service](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/connect-to-a-cloud-service/)
 
Learn how to create multiple virtual machines under the same cloud service to enable the machines to communicate with each other, to load-balance between virtual machines, and to maintain high availability of the machines.

###[How to Quickly Create a Virtual Machine](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/quickly-create-a-vm/)

Learn how to you use the Quick Create method to create a virtual machine in the management portal. When you create this machine, all you need to provide is the name of the machine, the image that is used to create the machine, and the password for the user account that is used to manage the machine.


###[How to Attach a Data Disk to a Virtual Machine](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/attach-a-disk/)

Learn how to attach a data disk to a virtual machine to store application data. A data disk is a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) that you can create either locally with your own computer or in the cloud with Windows Azure. 

###[How to Prepare a Linux Distribution for Windows Azure](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/prepare-a-linux-distribution/)

Learn how to customize and create images for the different distributions that our partners have tested.



###[How to use the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux](/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/command-line-tools/)
