<p>Monitoring data might tell you that performance issues could be fixed by scaling your web site. With Windows Azure, you can scale your site out in Shared mode. If you change to Standard mode, you can not only change the size and count of virtual machines, but you can also have Windows Azure automatically scale resources for your web site, which is more cost effective.</p>
