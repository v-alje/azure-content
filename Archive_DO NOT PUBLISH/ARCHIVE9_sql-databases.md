# SQL Database articles
SQL Database provides relational database management services on Windows Azure, and is based on SQL Server technology. With SQL Database, you can easily provision and deploy database instances, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing. 

## Tutorials
### [Getting Started with SQL Database](./get-started-sql-database/)
Learn the fundamentals of Windows Azure SQL Database administration using just the Windows Azure (Preview) Management portal and the instructions in this tutorial. 

## How to guides
### [How to: Configure SQL Database](./howto-configure-sqldb/)
In this guide, you'll step through logical server creation and configuration. In the new Windows Azure (Preview) Management Portal, revised workflows let you create a database first, and then create a server. However in this guide, you'll create the server first. You might prefer this approach if you have existing SQL Server databases that you want to upload.

###[How to: Connect to SQL Database using Management Studio](./howto-connect-sqldb/)
Use Management Studio to connect to a logical server on Windows Azure. This step requires you to have SQL Server Management Studio version 2008 R2 or 2012.

### [How to: Deploy SQL Database](./howto-deploy-sqldb/)
In the following step, you'll use Management Studio to connect to a logical server on Windows Azure. This step requires you to have SQL Server Management Studio version 2008 R2 or 2012.

###[How to: Add logins and users to SQL Database](./howto-add-users-sqldb/)
See how to quickly add logins and users using two scripts. For the first script, you'll connect to master and run a script that creates logins. The second script assigns database user permissions. 

### [How to: Monitor SQL Database](./howto-monitor-sqldb/)
Use Data Management Views (DMVs) to monitor data capacity, query problems, and current connections.

### [How to: Scale SQL Database](./howto-scale-sqldb/)
On Windows Azure, database scalability is synonymous with scale out, where a workload is redistributed across multiple commodity servers in a data center. Scale out is a strategy for addressing problems with data capacity or performance.

## Common tasks:
### [Managing SQL Database with SQL Server Management Studio](./manage-sql-database/)
The guidance describes how to use SQL Server Management Studio to manage SQL Database logical servers and databases in Windows Azure.
