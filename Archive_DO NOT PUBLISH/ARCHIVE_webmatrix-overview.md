Download it <a

FREE!</a>

##How to get started

It's easy to get started! <a
href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9809702">
Download WebMatrix for free</a>, then if you don't have Windows Azure, you can <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271784">sign up for a Windows Azure subscription here</a>

You can also sign into WebMatrix with your Microsoft account or organizational identity, and enable Windows Azure during sign in.

##Benefits of sign In

Once signed in, your name and picture will appear in the right-hand corner of WebMatrix. When you create a local site, you'll get an option to provision a remote companion site automatically. If you don't want to provision a remote site, it's easy to skip (and you can easily provision it later using the **Publish** button).

All of your sites on Windows Azure will be listed in My Sites, even if you’ve never previously opened them.

##Open your sites directly from Windows Azure

If you already have a live
web site hosted in Windows Azure that you want to start editing, you can click
the WebMatrix button in the Windows Azure portal. With this single click, you
can install WebMatrix and any prerequisites, and download a copy of the site to
your computer so that you can edit it locally.
