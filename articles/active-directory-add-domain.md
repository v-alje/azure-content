# Add your own domain name to Azure AD

When you sign up for a Microsoft cloud service, you are issued a domain name that has the following format: contoso.onmicrosoft.com. You can continue to use that initial domain name, or you can add your own custom domain name to the cloud service. This topic explains how to add your own domain name and related information.

## Background information about DNS and domain name services

Domains are managed by using a worldwide system of domain registrars and databases. The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a mapping between human-readable computer hostnames and the IP addresses used by networking equipment. An understanding of DNS and domain registrar basics will help administrators manage domains in your Microsoft Azure AD tenant. For more information about your Microsoft Azure AD tenant, see What is an Azure AD directory?

### Domain names 

Domain names are used in URLs and email addresses associated with one or more IP addresses. Domain names are constructed in levels. For example, mail.contoso.com is a domain name with the following three levels:

- .com is the top-level domain
- contoso is the second-level domain
- mail is the third-level domain

Sometimes third-level domains are used to designate webpages that serve specific functions, such as blog.contoso.com.

### Understand DNS record types and functions 

DNS records are used to direct traffic to and from your domain. These records associate a domain name with a specific IP address. The following table lists frequently used DNS records and their functions.

Record  | Description
	------------- | -------------
NS (name server) record | Identifies which name servers are the authoritative name servers for a specific domain. DNS information can be cached in several name servers for a period of time, but when the cache expires, non-authoritative name servers contact the authoritative name server for updated information about a domain. 
A or address record | Associates a domain name with an IP address.
CNAME (alias or canonical name) record | Specifies that the domain name is an alias of another canonical domain name. When a name server looks up a domain and finds a CNAME record, it replaces the first domain name with the CNAME and then looks up the new name.
MX (mail exchanger) record | Identifies the server to which email is directed. It also contains a priority field so that mail can be directed to multiple servers in a prescribed order.
SPF (sender policy framework) | An email validation system designed to help prevent email spoofing and phishing. 
SRV (service record) | Specifies information about available services. SRV records are used by some Microsoft cloud services such as Lync Online and Exchange Online to coordinate the flow of information between services. 
TTL (time-to-live) | The amount of time that a DNS record is retained or cached by a name server or other servers before the server does another lookup on the authoritative name server. You use this to control the number of queries made to a given name server. 

### About your onmicrosoft.com domain

You can use your onmicrosoft.com domain with other services. For example, you can use the domain with Exchange Online and Lync Online to create distribution lists and sign-in accounts so users can access SharePoint Online and site collections.

You cannot, however, host SharePoint Online on a onmicrosoft.com domain. SharePoint Online can only be hosted on your SharePoint domain, such as contoso.sharepoint.com, or with a custom domain, such as www.contoso.com, that you add to the cloud service.

If you add your own domain names to your directory, you can continue to use your onmicrosoft.com domain.

After you choose the name to use with the cloud service during signup, such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com, you cannot change the name. 

### How can I buy a domain name?

To add your own domain name to Azure AD, you, as an administrator, must own a domain and change some of the DNS records for your domain. If you don’t already own a domain name, you can purchase one from a domain name registrar. 

The following are some common domain registrars:

- [Go Daddy](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235592) 
- [Melbourne IT](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235593) 
- [Network Solutions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235594)
- [Hover](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235595)
- [eNom Central](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235596)
- [1&1 Internet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235597)
- [Register.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235598)

After you register your domain name, you can sign in to the cloud service and add the domain name.

### How can I find my domain name registrar?

Your domain name registrar usually, but not always, manages the DNS records for your domain. If your registrar does not manage your DNS records, you’ll need to locate your DNS service provider. If you don’t recall the domain name registrar where you registered your domain, follow the steps provided here to locate the correct registrar.

1. Open a browser, and then go to the [InterNIC](http://www.internic.com/whois.html) search page. 
2. In the **Whois Search** box, type your domain name; for example, contoso.com. 
3. Select the **Domain** option, and then click **Submit**.
4. On the **Whois Search Results** page, locate the **Registrar** entry. This entry lists the name of the organization that provides registrar service for the domain name that you entered.

### How can I find my DNS service provider?

1. Open a browser, and then go to the [InterNIC](http://www.internic.com/whois.html) search page. 
2. In the **Whois Search** box, type your domain name; for example, contoso.com. 
3. Select the **Domain** option, and then click **Submit**.
4. On the **Whois Search Results** page, locate the first **Name Server** entry.
5. Copy the name server information that appears after the colon (:), and then paste it into the **Search** box at the top of the page. Select **Nameserver**, and then click **Submit**.
6. On the **Whois Search Results** page, locate the **Registrar** entry. This entry lists the DNS service provider who owns the name server.

## How can I add my own domain?

If your organization already has a custom domain name, as an administrator, you can add it to your Azure AD directory to use with all of the Microsoft online services that you have subscribed to. After you’ve added your domain name to Azure AD, you can start associating your domain name with your various cloud services.

You can add up to 900 domain names to your Azure AD tenant by using, either: 

- The Azure classic portal, the Office 365 portal, or the Microsoft Intune portal.
- The Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell. For more information about which cmdlet you can use for this, see [Manage domains](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn919677.aspx).

You must have already registered a domain name and have the sign-in credentials needed for your domain name registrar (for example, Go Daddy or Register.com). 

You can add multiple domains to your directory. However, you can’t add the same domain to different directories. So, for example, If you add your domain to your directory, you can't create another Azure AD directory and add the same domain name to it.

If you plan to use single sign-on with the cloud service, we recommend that you help prepare your Active Directory environment by running the Microsoft Deployment Readiness Tool. This tool inspects your Active Directory environment and provides a report that includes information about whether you are ready to set up single sign-on. If not, it lists the changes you need to make to prepare for single sign-on. For example, it inspects whether your users have UPNs and if those UPNs are in the correct format. To download the tool, see [Microsoft Deployment Readiness Tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235650).

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> Using Office 365? Once you have set up your domain, you can start creating email addresses, Lync Online accounts, and distribution groups that use your custom domain name. You can also use your domain name for a public-facing website hosted on SharePoint Online.

- Add and verify a domain using the Azure classic portal 
- Specify the services you’ll use with your domain 
- Edit DNS records for your cloud services
- Verify a domain at any domain name registrar 
- Check domain status
- For Office 365 Customers: Host a public-facing website with your domain name together with Exchange Online or Lync Online

### Add and verify a domain using the Azure classic portal

1. In the portal, click **Active Directory**, and then click on the name of your organization’s directory.You can do one of the following:
    1. On the default directory page, click **Add Domain** in the **Improve user sign-in experience **section. 
    2. Click **Domains** and then click either **Add a customer domain** or the **Add** button.
2. On the **Add domain** page, type the domain name that you want to add and the do one of the following:
    1. If you do not plan to integrate your on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, do the following:
        1. Leave the **I plan to configure this domain for single sign-on with my local Active Directory** checkbox unchecked and click the **Add** button.
        2. After you see the message that your domain has been successfully added to Azure AD, click the arrow to move to the next page so you can verify your domain.
        3. Follow the directions on the next page to verify that the domain name you added in the previous steps belongs to you. For step-by-step directions, see Verify a domain at any domain name registrar.
    2. If you want to integrate your on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, do the following:
        1. Make sure to check the **I plan to configure this domain for single sign-on with my local Active Directory** checkbox and then click the **Add** button.
        2. After you see the message that your domain has been successfully added to Azure AD, click the arrow to move to the next page and then follow the directions on that page to configure the domain you added for single sign-on.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> After you add your domain name to Azure AD, you can change the default domain name for new email addresses. For more information, see How can I change the primary domain  name for my users? You can also edit the profile for an existing user account to update the email address (which is also your user ID) to use your custom domain name instead of the onmicrosoft.com domain. 

### Specify the services you’ll use with your domain

When you add your domain name to Azure AD, you might need to specify the services that you’ll use with your domain name.

In a couple of scenarios, you have to specify which domain services you intend to use with a domain name. Why do you have to tell us which services you’ll use? This lets us make sure that you can see and update the DNS records in the cloud service for the services you want.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> Using Office 365? You have to specify which domain services you intend to use when you do either of the following:

- You add your custom domain name to Azure AD by using the wizard and want to use your domain name for a public website on SharePoint Online.

    If you want to create a SharePoint Online public-facing website that uses your domain name, you must specify SharePoint Online as the domain service you plan to use. However, you can’t also choose Exchange Online or Lync Online if you have already set up SharePoint Online as the service you’ll use with the domain name. To learn about how to work around this set up restriction, see For Office 365 Customers: Host a public-facing website with your domain name together with Exchange Online or Lync Online.
- You add your domain by using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell. When you use the tool to add your domain name, you always have to choose the services you want to use with the domain name.

To set the domain services for your domain name in the **Add a domain** wizard, select them on the **Specify services** page. 

To edit your domain services list later:
1. On the portal, in the left pane, click **Domains**.
2. Click a domain name, and on the **Domain properties**  page, click **Edit domain services**.

### Edit DNS records for your cloud services

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> Using Microsoft Intune? You do not need to edit DNS records for the Windows Intune cloud service.

After you add and verify your custom domain name, the next step is to edit the DNS records at your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider that point traffic to your cloud service. Azure AD provides the DNS information that you need.

If you’ve just completed the **Add a domain** wizard, click **Configure DNS records**. Otherwise, follow these steps.

1. In the portal, in the left pane, click **Domains**.
2. Depending on which portal you are using, click the domain name that you want to set up, and then click either **DNS settings** or **View DNS settings**. The **DNS settings** page lists the DNS records for the cloud service.

    If you want to configure a service that you don’t see on the DNS settings tab, check your domain services selections to make sure you’ve chosen that service for this domain name. To change the settings, for example, to add Lync Online, see Specify the services you’ll use with your domain.

3. At your domain name registrar website, add the required records to your DNS file.

Typically it takes about 15 minutes for your changes to take effect. But it can take up to 72 hours for the DNS record that you created to propagate through the DNS system. If you need to view these record settings again, on the **Domains** page, click the domain, and then, on the **Domain properties** page, click the **DNS settings** tab.

To check the status of your domain, on the **Domains** page, click the domain, and then, on the **Domain properties** page, click **Troubleshoot domain**.

### Check domain status

On the **Domains** page, you can view the status of each of your domain names in the cloud service. The following table lists the status options for domains.

 Status  | Definition
------------- | -------------
**Click to verify domain** | The domain has been added to your account, but the cloud service has not yet verified that you own the domain. You cannot use the domain with any of the services until verification is complete. Click the status to go verify your domain.
**Active** | The initial onmicrosoft.com domain that is created when you open your account has this status.
**Verified** | The domain has been successfully added and the cloud service has verified that you own it.
**Pending deletion** | The cloud service has started removing the domain, but the removal process isn’t complete, or there is an issue with removing the domain. 

### Verify a domain at any domain name registrar

If you already have a domain registered with a domain name registrar, and you want to configure it to work with Azure AD, domain verification is required to confirm that you own the domain. To verify your domain, you create a DNS record at the domain name registrar, or wherever your DNS is hosted, and then Azure AD uses that record to confirm that you own the domain.

Before you can verify your domain, you must add a custom domain to Azure AD. When you’ve added a custom domain but the domain hasn’t yet been verified, the status will either show as **Click to verify domain** or **Unverified**.

#### Gather your domain information 

Based on the portal you are using to administer your Azure AD directory, you’ll need to collect some information about your domain so that you can later create a DNS record that will be used during the verification process. 

If you are using Microsoft Intune or the Azure Account Portal:
1. On the **Domains** page, in the list of domain names, find the domain that you are verifying. In the **Status** column, click** Click to verify domain**.
2. On the **Verify domain** page, in the **See instructions for performing this step with:** drop-down list, choose your DNS hosting provider. If your provider doesn’t appear in the list, choose **General instructions**.
3. In the **Select a verification method:** drop-down list, choose **Add a TXT record (preferred method)** or **Add an MX record (alternate method)**. 
    If your DNS hosting provider allows you create TXT records, we recommend you use a TXT record for verification. Why? TXT records are straightforward to create and don’t introduce the possibility of interfering with email delivery if an incorrect value is accidentally entered.
4. From the table, copy or record the **Destination or Points to Address** information.

If you are using the classic portal:

1. In the portal, click **Active Directory**, click the name of your directory, click **Domains**. 
2. On the **Domains** page, in the list of domain names, click the domain that you want to verify, and then click **Verify**.
2. On the **Verify** page, in the **Record Type** drop-down list, choose either **TXT record** or **MX record**.
3. Copy or record the information under it.

#### Add a DNS record at your domain name registrar 

Azure AD uses a DNS record that you create at your domain name registrar to confirm that you own the domain. Use the instructions below to create either a TXT or MX record type for a domain that is registered at your registrar.

If your domain registrar does not accept “@” as a hostname, contact your domain registrar to find out how to represent “parent of the current zone.”

To add a TXT or MX record:

1. Sign in to your domain name registrar’s website, and then select the domain that you’re verifying.
2. In the DNS management area for your account, select the option to add a TXT or an MX record for your domain.
3. In the **TXT** or **MX** box for the domain, type the following: @
4. In the **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** or **Points to** box, type or paste the **Destination or Points to Address** that you recorded in the previous step.
5. For a TXT record, it asks for **TTL** information, type **1** to set TTL to one hour. 

    For an MX record, it asks for a priority (or preference), type a number that is larger than the number you’ve specified for existing MX records. This can help prevent the new MX record from interfering with mail routing for the domain. Instead of a priority, you may see the following options: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**. In this case, choose **Low**.

6. Save your changes, and then sign out of your domain name registrar’s website.

After you create either the TXT record or the MX record and sign out of the website, return to the cloud service to verify the domain. Typically it takes about 15 minutes for your changes to take effect. But it can take up to 72 hours for the record that you created to propagate through the DNS system.

#### Verify your domain 

After the record that you created for your domain has propagated successfully through the DNS system, do the following to finish verifying your domain with Azure AD.

1. In the portal, click **Domains**.
2. In the **Domains** list, find the domain that you’re verifying, and then based on the portal you are using, click either **Click to verify domain** or **Verify**.
3. Follow the instructions provided to complete the verification process.
    - If domain verification succeeds, you will be notified that your domain has been added to your account.
    - If domain verification fails, then the changes that you made at the domain registrar might need more time to propagate. Cancel the verification process, and return later to try the verification again.

If it has been more than 72 hours since you made the changes to your domain, sign in to the domain registrar’s website and verify that you entered the alias information correctly. If you entered the information incorrectly, you must remove the incorrect DNS record and create a new one with the correct information by using the procedures in this topic.

After you’ve verified your domain, you can configure your domain to work with your accounts.

### For Office 365 Customers: Host a public-facing website with your domain name together with Exchange Online or Lync Online

In Office 365, you can host your SharePoint Online public website on the same domain as Exchange Online and Lync Online, but there are several additional steps you have to take. 

Here’s what you need to do:

1. Run the Add your domain wizard to add your domain name, for example, contoso.com, to Office 365 and verify that you own the domain. In the wizard, set the domain services option to Exchange Online, Lync Online, or both Exchange Online and Lync Online.

     > [AZURE.NOTE]
     > Do not enable the SharePoint Online service yet. You’ll add it later.

2. Add the required DNS records for Exchange Online and Lync Online to work with your domain name. Add the records where you host DNS records for your domain name, which could be your domain registrar, another DNS hosting provider, or an on-premises DNS server.

    After you create the DNS records and they propagate through the DNS system, traffic will begin to go to Exchange Online and Lync Online.

3. Run the Add a domain wizard again, and this time add a third-level domain to Office 365 with the format label.contoso.com, where label is a value that completes the website address for the website you want to host on SharePoint Online. For example, you could set label to be www so your website would be located at http://www.contoso.com.

    When you add the domain, set the domain services options to SharePoint Online.

4. On the SharePoint Online Administration Center, create your SharePoint Online public-facing website, and then associate it with the third-level domain name you added in the previous step, for example, www.contoso.com. 
5. Create a CNAME record for SharePoint Online at your domain name registrar in the same area where you created the DNS records for Exchange Online and Lync Online.

    When you create the CNAME record, specify the host name of the record as the same label that you chose earlier, for example, www. The SharePoint Online Administration Center provides the target address for the CNAME record is provided to you by the SharePoint Online Administration Center.

    > [AZURE.WARNING]
    > When you create the CNAME record, be aware of the following:
    > - Make sure that you set up the CNAME record this way to route traffic to your SharePoint Online website. Otherwise, the record could prevent other DNS records for your domain from working correctly, so that, for example, your email service might be disrupted.
    > - When you specify the host header name, you must explicitly specify the domain name that you want to use with SharePoint Online. This is because Office 365 uses the host header name that you configure for your DNS records to map your domain to the corresponding site collection in SharePoint Online.

After you create the CNAME record and the record propagates through the DNS system, traffic for your website (for example, http://www.contoso.com) will be directed to the website at SharePoint Online. Typically it takes about 15 minutes for your changes to take effect. But it can take up to 72 hours for the record that you created to propagate through the DNS system.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> You cannot host the three services together on your domain if you want to host your website on the same third-level, or greater, domain as you are also hosting other services. For example, you cannot host your website on http://partners.contoso.com and also use email addresses, such as user@partners.contoso.com.

## How can I change the primary domain  name for my users?

After you add your domain name to Azure AD, you can change the domain name that should show as the default when you create a new user account. To do this, follow these steps.

1. On the portal page, in the top left corner, click your organization name.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Choose a new default domain name, such as the custom domain name that you added.

## How can I remove a domain?

Before you remove a domain name, we recommend that you read the following information:

- The original contoso.onmicrosoft.com domain name that was provided for your directory when you signed up cannot be removed. 
- Any top-level domain that has subdomains associated with it cannot be removed until the subdomains have been removed. For example, you can’t remove adatum.com if you have corp.adatum.com or another subdomain that uses the top-level domain name. For more information, see this [Support article](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2787792/).
- Have you activated directory synchronization? If so, a domain was automatically added to your account that looks similar to this: contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com. This domain name can’t be removed.
- Before you can remove a domain name, you must first remove the domain name from all user or email accounts associated with the domain. You can remove all of the accounts, or you can bulk edit user accounts to change their domain name information and email addresses. For more information, see [Create or edit users in Azure AD](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh967632.aspx).
- If you are hosting a SharePoint Online site on a domain name that is being used for a SharePoint Online site collection, you must delete the site collection before you can remove the domain name.

To remove a domain name:

1. On the portal page, in the left pane, click **Domains**.
2. On the **Domains** page, select the domain name that you want to remove, and then click **Remove domain**.
3. On the **Remove domain** page, click **Yes**.

If your domain name can’t be removed at this time, the status for the domain name is shown as Pending removal on the Domains page. If you continue to see this status, try again to remove the domain name.

## Troubleshooting problems after changing your domain name 

### I made changes to my domain, but it doesn’t show the changes yet.

Because of the way updates move through the domain name system (DNS), it can take up to 72 hours before the changes you make at a domain registrar or hosting provider fully propagate through the Internet and you can begin using your domain name with your services.

In addition, the edits that you make at the domain registrar must be exactly correct. If you go back to correct an error, it may take several days for the updated setting to appear on the cloud service portal site.

How long will it take? It depends in part on the time to live (TTL) setting you’ve specified for the DNS record that you are replacing or updating. Until the TTL expires, Internet servers that have cached the previous data won’t query the authoritative name server to request the new value. 

### I added a domain, verified it, and configured the DNS records on the domain registrar site. Why aren’t new email accounts getting mail yet? 

After you have finished adding or updating DNS records for your domain, it can take up to 72 hours for the changes to take effect.

In addition, the settings information must be exactly correct on the domain registrar site. Double-check your settings, and make sure that you’ve allowed enough time for the changed DNS records to propagate through the system.

### I can’t verify my domain name. How can I find out what’s wrong? 

One way to track down issues is to use the domains troubleshooting wizard. To start the wizard, do the following: In the cloud service portal, on the Admin page, click **Domains**, and then double-click the domain name that you want to verify. Then, under **Troubleshooting**, click **Troubleshoot domain**. 

The troubleshooting wizard asks you for information about where you are in the verification process, and then provides you with information to help you complete the verification.

### I added and verified my domain, but the new domain name isn’t working for existing users’ email addresses. 

If you add your custom domain name to the cloud service after you have already added user accounts, you may have to make updates to use the new domain name. For example, you will need to edit your users’ accounts to set their email addresses to use your custom domain.
