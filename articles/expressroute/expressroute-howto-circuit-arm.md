> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
[PowerShell - Classic](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md)
[PowerShell - Resource Manager](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md)

This article walks you through the steps to create an ExpressRoute circuit using PowerShell cmdlets and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. The steps below will also show you how to check the status, update, or delete and deprovision an ExpressRoute circuit. 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-sm-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-sm-rm-include.md)] 

## Configuration prerequisites

- You will need the latest version of the Azure PowerShell modules, version 1.0 or later. Follow the instructions on the [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) page for step-by-step guidance on how to configure your computer to use the Azure PowerShell modules. 
- Make sure that you have reviewed the [Prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) page and the [Workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) page before you begin configuration.

## To create and provision an ExpressRoute circuit

1. **Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.**

 	You must install the latest PowerShell installer from [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and import the Azure Resource Manager modules into the PowerShell session in order to start using the ExpressRoute cmdlets. You will need to run PowerShell as an Administrator.

	    Install-Module AzureRM

		Install-AzureRM

	Import all of the AzureRM.* modules within the known semantic version range

		Import-AzureRM

	You can also just import a select module within the known semantic version range 
		
		Import-Module AzureRM.Network 

	Logon to your account

		Login-AzureRmAccount

	Select the subscription you want to create ExpressRoute circuit
		
		Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscription ID>"
			


2. **Get the list of providers, locations, and bandwidths supported.**

	Before creating an ExpressRoute circuit, you will need the list of connectivity providers, supported locations, and bandwidth options. The PowerShell cmdlet *Get-AzureRmExpressRouteServiceProvider* returns this information, which you’ll use in later steps.

		Get-AzureRmExpressRouteServiceProvider

	Check to see if your connectivity provider is listed there. Make note of the following as you will need them to create circuits.
	
	- Name
	- PeeringLocations
	- BandwidthsOffered

	You are now ready to create an ExpressRoute circuit.

		
3. **Create an ExpressRoute circuit.**

	You must first create a resource group if you don't already have one before you create your ExpressRoute circuit. You can do so by running the following command.

		New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name “ExpressRouteResourceGroup” -Location "West US"

	The example below shows how to create a 200 Mbps ExpressRoute circuit through Equinix in Silicon Valley. If you are using a different provider and different settings, substitute that information when making your request.

	Below is an example request for a new service key:

		New-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup" -Location "West US" -SkuTier Standard -SkuFamily MeteredData -ServiceProviderName "Equinix" -PeeringLocation "Silicon Valley" -BandwidthInMbps 200

	Make sure that you specify the right SKU tier and SKU family.
 
	 - SKU tier determines whether ExpressRoute standard or ExpressRoute premium add-on is enabled. You can specify *standard* to get the standard SKU or *premium* for premium add-on
	 - SKU family determines the billing type. You can select *metereddata* for metered data plan and *unlimiteddata" for unlimited data plan. **Note:** You will not be able to change the billing type once a circuit is created. 

	
	The response will contain the service key. You can get detailed descriptions of all the parameters by running the following:

		Get-Help New-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -detailed 

4. **List all ExpressRoute circuits.**

	You can run the *Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit* command to get a list of all ExpressRoute circuits you created.

		
		Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

	The response will be something similar to the example below:

		Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
		Location                         : westus
		Id                               : /subscriptions/***************************/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		Etag                             : W/"################################"
		ProvisioningState                : Succeeded
		Sku                              : {
		                                     "Name": "Standard_MeteredData",
		                                     "Tier": "Standard",
		                                     "Family": "MeteredData"
		                                   }
		CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled
		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
		ServiceProviderNotes             : 
		ServiceProviderProperties        : {
		                                     "ServiceProviderName": "Equinix",
		                                     "PeeringLocation": "Silicon Valley",
		                                     "BandwidthInMbps": 200
		                                   }
		ServiceKey                       : **************************************
		Peerings                         : []


	You can retrieve this information at any time using the *Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit* cmdlet. Making the call without any parameters will list all circuits. Your Service Key will be listed in the *ServiceKey* field.

		Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit

	The response will be something similar to the example below:

		Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
		Location                         : westus
		Id                               : /subscriptions/***************************/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		Etag                             : W/"################################"
		ProvisioningState                : Succeeded
		Sku                              : {
		                                     "Name": "Standard_MeteredData",
		                                     "Tier": "Standard",
		                                     "Family": "MeteredData"
		                                   }
		CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled
		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
		ServiceProviderNotes             : 
		ServiceProviderProperties        : {
		                                     "ServiceProviderName": "Equinix",
		                                     "PeeringLocation": "Silicon Valley",
		                                     "BandwidthInMbps": 200
		                                   }
		ServiceKey                       : **************************************
		Peerings                         : []



	You can get detailed descriptions of all the parameters by running the following:

		Get-Help Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -detailed 

5. **Send the Service Key to your connectivity provider for provisioning.**

	When you create a new ExpressRoute circuit, the circuit will be the following state:
	
		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
		
		CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled

	The *ServiceProviderProvisioningState* provides information on the current state of provisioning on the service provider side, and the Status provides the state on the Microsoft side. An ExpressRoute circuit must be in the following state for you to be able to use it.

		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
		
		CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled

	The circuit will go to the following state when the connectivity provider is in the process of enabling it for you. 

		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
		
		Status                           : Enabled



6. **Periodically check the status and the state of the circuit key.**

	This lets you know when your provider has enabled your circuit. Once the circuit has been configured, the *ServiceProviderProvisioningState* will display as *Provisioned* as shown in the example below.

		Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

	The response will be something similar to the example below:

		Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
		Location                         : westus
		Id                               : /subscriptions/***************************/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit
		Etag                             : W/"################################"
		ProvisioningState                : Succeeded
		Sku                              : {
		                                     "Name": "Standard_MeteredData",
		                                     "Tier": "Standard",
		                                     "Family": "MeteredData"
		                                   }
		CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled
		ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
		ServiceProviderNotes             : 
		ServiceProviderProperties        : {
		                                     "ServiceProviderName": "Equinix",
		                                     "PeeringLocation": "Silicon Valley",
		                                     "BandwidthInMbps": 200
		                                   }
		ServiceKey                       : **************************************
		Peerings                         : []

7. **Configure routing and link a VNet**

	a. **Create your routing configuration.** Refer to [Create and modify routing for an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md) for step-by-step instructions. Note that the instructions for routing only apply for circuits created with service providers offering Layer 2 connectivity services. If you are using a service provider offering managed Layer 3 services (typically an IPVPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider will configure and manage routing for you. You will not be able to create or manage peerings in such cases.
	
	b. **Link your VNet to an ExpressRoute circuit.** After you verify that routing has been configured, you'll need to link your VNet to your ExpressRoute circuit. Refer to [Linking virtual networks to ExpressRoute circuits](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md) for step-by-step instructions.

##  To get the status of an ExpressRoute circuit

You can retrieve this information at any time using the *Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit* cmdlet. Making the call without any parameters will list all circuits. 

		Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit

The response will be similar to the example below:

		Peerings                         : []

You can get detailed descriptions of all the parameters by running the following:

		Get-Help Get-azurededicatedcircuit -detailed 

## To modify an ExpressRoute circuit

You can modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity. Refer to the [ExpressRoute FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md) page for more information on limits and limitations. 

You can modify the following settings without incurring downtime:

- Enable or Disable the ExpressRoute premium add-on for your ExpressRoute circuit without any downtime.
- Increase the bandwidth of your ExpressRoute circuit without any downtime.



### How to enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on

You can enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on for your existing circuit using the following PowerShell snippet:

		$ckt = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

		$ckt.Sku.Tier = "Premium"
		$ckt.sku.Name = "Premium_MeteredData"

		Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
	
		
Your circuit will now have the ExpressRoute premium add-on features enabled. Note that we will start billing you for the premium add-on capability as soon as the command has successfully run.

### How to disable the ExpressRoute premium add-on

You can disable the ExpressRoute premium add-on for your existing circuit. When disabling the ExpressRoute premium add-on, note the following considerations:

- You must ensure that the number of virtual networks linked to the circuit is less than 10 before you downgrade from premium to standard. If you don't do so, your update request will fail, and you will be billed the premium rates.
- You must unlink all virtual networks in other geopolitical regions. If you don't do so, your update request will fail and you will be billed the premium rates.
- Your route table must be less than 4000 routes for private peering. If your route table size is greater than 4000 routes, the BGP session will drop and won't be re-enabled till the number of advertised prefixes goes below 4000.

To disable the premium add-on, use the PowerShell cmdlet sample below. This operation can fail if you are using resources greater than what is permitted for the standard circuit.
	
		$ckt = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"
		
		$ckt.Sku.Tier = "Standard"
		$ckt.sku.Name = "Standard_MeteredData"
		
		Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt

### How to update the ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth

Check the [ExpressRoute FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md) page for supported bandwidth options for your provider. You can pick any size **greater** than the size of your existing circuit without incurring downtime.

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] You cannot reduce the bandwidth of an ExpressRoute circuit without disruption. Downgrading bandwidth will require you to deprovision the ExpressRoute circuit, and then re-provision a new ExpressRoute circuit.

Once you decided what size you need, you can use the following sample, below,  to resize your circuit. After you run the cmdlets, your circuit will have been sized up on the Microsoft side. You must contact your connectivity provider to update configurations on their side to match this change. Note that we will start billing you for the updated bandwidth option from this point on.

		$ckt = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

		$ckt.ServiceProviderProperties.BandwidthInMbps = 1000

		Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt

## To delete and deprovision an ExpressRoute circuit

You can delete your ExpressRoute circuit. When deleting an ExpressRoute circuit, note the following considerations:

- You must unlink all virtual networks from the ExpressRoute for this operation to succeed. Check if you have any virtual networks linked to the circuit if this operation fails.

- If the ExpressRoute circuit service provider provisioning state is enabled, the status will move to *disabling* from the enabled state. You must work with your service provider to deprovision the circuit on their side. We will continue to reserve resources and bill you until the service provider completes deprovisioning the circuit and sends us a notification.

- If the service provider has deprovisioned the circuit (the service provider provisioning state is set to *not provisioned*) before you run the cmdlet, we will deprovision the circuit and stop billing you. 

To delete your ExpressRoute circuit, use the PowerShell cmdlet sample below.

		Remove-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup" -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit"

## Next steps

After you have created your circuit, make sure that you do the following: 

1.  [Create and modify routing for your ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md)
2.  [Link your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md)
