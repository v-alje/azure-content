# Create a DocumentDB collection

To use Microsoft Azure DocumentDB, you must have a [DocumentDB account](documentdb-create-account.md), a [database](documentdb-create-database.md), a collection, and documents. This topic describes how to create a DocumentDB collection in the Azure portal. 

Not sure what a collection is? See [What is a DocumentDB collection?](#what-is-a-documentdb-collection)

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the Jumpbar, click **DocumentDB Accounts**. 

2.  In the **DocumentDB Accounts** blade, select the account in which to add a collection. If you don't have any accounts listed, you'll need to [create a DocumentDB account](documentdb-create-account.md).

3. In the **DocumentDB account** blade for the selected account, scroll down to the **Databases** lens, and then select the database in which to add a collection.
    
4. In the **Database** blade, click **Add collections**.

5. In the **Add Collection** blade, enter the ID for your new collection. Collection names must be between 1 and 255 characters, and cannot contain `/ \ # ?` or a trailing space. When the name is validated, a green check mark appears in the ID box.

6. Select a pricing tier for the new collection. Each collection you create is a billable entity. For more information about the performance levels available, see [Performance levels in DocumentDB](documentdb-performance-levels.md).

7. Select one of the following **Indexing Policies**. 

	- **Default**. This policy uses hash indexing for strings and range indexing for numbers. It is best for equality queries against strings, ORDER BY, and range and equality queries on numbers. This policy has a lower index storage overhead and includes geospatial indexing.
	- **Range**. This policy is best when youâ€™re using ORDER BY, range and equality queries on both numbers and strings.  This policy has a higher index storage overhead than **Default** and includes geospatial indexing.

	For more information about the indexing policies, see [DocumentDB indexing policies](documentdb-indexing-policies.md).

8. Click **OK** at the bottom of the screen to create the new collection. 


9. The new collection now appears in the **Collections** lens on the **Database** blade.

## What is a DocumentDB collection? 

A collection is a container of JSON documents and the associated JavaScript application logic. A collection is a billable entity, where the [cost](documentdb-performance-levels.md) is determined by the performance level associated with the collection. 

Collections are the transaction boundary for stored procedures and triggers, and the entry point to queries and CRUD operations. Each collection has a reserved amount of throughput specific to that collection, which is not shared with other collections in the same account. Therefore, you can scale out your application both in terms of storage and throughput by adding more collections, and then distributing your documents across them.

Collections are not the same as tables in relational databases. Collections do not enforce schema, in fact DocumentDB does not enforce any schemas, it's a schema-free database. Therefore you can store different types of documents with diverse schemas in the same collection. You can choose to use collections to store objects of a single type like you would with tables. The best model depends only on how the data appears together in queries and transactions.

## Other ways to create a DocumentDB collection

Collections do not have to be created using the portal, you can also create them using the [DocumentDB SDKs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn781482.aspx). For a C# code sample showing how to create a collection using the DocumentDB .NET SDK, see the [Program.cs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-net/blob/master/samples/code-samples/CollectionManagement/Program.cs) file in the CollectionManagement project, available in the [azure-documentdb-net](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-net) repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

## Troubleshooting

If **Add Collection** is disabled in the Azure portal, that means your account is currently disabled, which normally occurs when all the benefits credits for the month are used.	

## Next steps

Now that you have a collection, the next step is to add documents or import documents into the collection. When it comes to adding documents to a collection, you have a few choices:

- You can [add documents](documentdb-view-json-document-explorer.md) by using the Document Explorer in the portal.
- You can [import documents and data](documentdb-import-data.md) by using the DocumentDB Data Migration Tool, which enables you to import JSON and CSV files, as well as data from SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure Table storage, and other DocumentDB collections. 
- Or you can add documents by using one of the [DocumentDB SDKs](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md). DocumentDB has .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and JavaScript API SDKs. The [Program.cs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-net/blob/master/samples/code-samples/DocumentManagement/Program.cs) file in the DocumentManagement project, available in the [azure-documentdb-net](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-net) repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com), demonstrates CRUD operations on documents by using the DocumentDB .NET SDK.

After you have documents in a collection, you can use [DocumentDB SQL](documentdb-sql-query.md) to [execute queries](documentdb-sql-query.md#executing-queries) against your documents by using the [Query Explorer](documentdb-query-collections-query-explorer.md) in the portal, the [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn781481.aspx), or one of the [SDKs](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md).
