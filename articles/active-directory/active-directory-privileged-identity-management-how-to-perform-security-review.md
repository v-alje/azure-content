# Azure Privileged Identity Management: How to perform a security review


It is very easy to review privileged access once a [security review has been started](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-how-to-start-security-review.md).

## For reviewers: Approving or denying access

### Me review
1. In the PIM main menu, click **Review administrative access**. A list of security reviews will appear.
2. Select the **user(s)** in the list for which you want to change access. NOTE: Access will actually be changed.  This process is simply building a checklist for those who would change the access for the role.  Once at least one user has been selected the **Approve access** and **Deny access** buttons will be enabled.
3. Click either  **Approve access** or **Deny access** for the users you have selected.  A notification will appear in the Azure portal main menu and the review list will disappear.  Close the **Review Azure AD roles** blade.

### Self-review
1. The user will receive an email indicating that they should review their access.  The email will contain a link for logging in to the Azure portal.
2. Once there, the user can approve or deny their own access by clicking on the  **Approve access** or **Deny access** buttons.  Their name will disappear from the list.

## For review managers: Managing security reviews

## Completing or stopping a review
1. Go to the PIM dashboard.
2. Click on the security review you want to complete in the **Security reviews** list. The security review's detail blade will appear.
