# Azure Privileged Identity Management: How to activate or deactivate a role

## Activating or deactivating a role

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Follow the steps in [Getting Started with Azure Privileged Identity Management](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-getting-started.md) to place Azure PIM on the Azure portal dashboard.
3. After you have completed the steps in the Security Wizard, you will see the main menu of Azure PIM.
4. Click on **Activate my role**.
5. A list of roles that have been assigned to you will appear.
6. Click on the role you want to activate.
7. Click **Activate**. The **Request role activation** blade will appear.
8. Enter the reason for the activation request in the text field.
9. Click **OK**.  The role will now be activated.
10. Once a role has been activated you can also deactivate a role by clicking **Deactivate**.  Additionally, the role can be removed from the user by using the steps in [Adding or Removing a Role](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-how-to-add-role-to-user.md).
