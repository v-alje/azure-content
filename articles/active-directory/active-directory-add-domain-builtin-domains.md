# Built-in domain name reference for Azure Active Directory

This is intended as a quick reference for some of the terms and ideas used when discussing adding or removing custom domains in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

-   Built in: the domain that comes with your Azure AD directory, in the form of contoso.onmicrosoft.com

-   Custom: a domain name that your organization already owns, such as contoso.com

## Lower-level domains

- Second level domain: Example – contoso.com

- Third level domain: Example – Europe.contoso.com

## Status of domains

-   Verified: Azure AD has confirmed that your organization owns this domain.

-   Unverified: Azure AD has confirmed that your organization owns this domain.
