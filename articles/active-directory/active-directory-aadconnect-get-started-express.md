## Express installation of Azure AD Connect
Selecting Express Settings is the default option and is one of the most common scenarios. When doing this, Azure AD Connect deploys sync with the password sync option. This is for a single forest only and allows your users to use their on-premises password to sign-in to the cloud. Using the Express Settings will automatically kick off a synchronization once the installation is complete (though you can choose not to do this). With this option there are only a few short clicks to extending your on-premises directory to the cloud.

### To install Azure AD Connect using express settings

1. Login to the server you wish to install Azure AD Connect on a local Administrator.  This should be the server you wish to be the sync server.
2. Navigate to and double-click on AzureADConnect.msi
3. On the Welcome screen, select the box agreeing to the licensing terms and click **Continue**.
4. On the Express settings screen, click **Use express settings**.

5. On the Connect to Azure AD screen, enter the username and password of an Azure global administrator for your Azure AD. Click **Next**. If you receive an error and have problems with connectivity, please see [Troubleshoot connectivity problems](active-directory-aadconnect-troubleshoot-connectivity.md).
6. On the Connect to AD DS screen enter the username and password for an enterprise admin account.  Click **Next**.

7. On the Ready to configure screen, click **Install**.
	- Optionally on the Ready to Configure page, you can un-check the “**Start the synchronization process as soon as configuration completes**” checkbox.  If you do this, the wizard will configure sync but will leave the task disabled so it will not run until you enable it manually in the Task Scheduler.  Once the task is enabled, synchronization will run every three hours.
	- Also optionally you can choose to configure sync services for **Exchange Hybrid deployment** by checking the corresponding checkbox.  If you don’t plan to have Exchange mailboxes both in the cloud and on premises, you do not need this.
