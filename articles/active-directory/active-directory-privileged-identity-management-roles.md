# Azure Privileged Identity Management: Roles

<!-- **PLACEHOLDER: Need description of how this works. Azure PIM uses roles from MSODS objects.**-->

## Roles from Azure Active Directory, Office 365, and other sources

Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) uses the following roles as default administrator roles:

- Global Administrator
- Billing Administrator
- Service Administrator
- User Administrator
- Password Administrator

For more information about roles from Office 365, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Skype for Business go to [Assigning admin roles in Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assigning-admin-roles-in-Office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

<!--**PLACEHOLDER: The above article may not be the one we want since PIM gets roles from places other that Office 365**-->


<!-- ## The PIM Security Administrator Role **PLACEHOLDER: Need description of the Security Administrator role.**-->

## User Roles and Logging In
> [AZURE.NOTE]In order for a user to be able to sign in to Azure PIM, they must have a license for Azure.

## Assigning a License to a User in Azure AD
