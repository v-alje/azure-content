# Azure Privileged Identity Management: How to configure security alerts

## Security alerts overview
Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) offers the following alerts which can be configured. Security alerts can be viewed in the Alerts section of the PIM dashboard.

| Alert | Trigger |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Permanent activation attack suspected** | An administrator activated its temporary role outside of PIM. |
| **Suspicious activation renewal of privileged roles** | There were too many re-activations of the same role within the time allowed in the settings. |
| **Suspicious usage of honey token Global administrator user** | The usage of a “honey pot” user was detected.|
| **Weak authentication is configured for role activation** | There are roles without MFA in the settings. |
| **Redundant administrators increase your attack surface** | There are temporary administrators that didn’t activate their roles within the number of days in the settings. |
| **Too many global administrators increase your attack surface** | There are more global administrators than allowed in the settings. |
