# Working with claims aware apps in Application Proxy

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Application Proxy is a feature that is available only if you upgraded to the Premium or Basic edition of Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](active-directory-editions.md).

Claims aware apps perform a redirection to the Security Token Service (STS), which in turn requests credentials from the user in exchange for a token before redirecting the user to the application. To enable Application Proxy to work with these redirects, the following steps need to be taken.

## Prerequisite

Before performing this procedure, make sure that the STS the claims aware app redirects to is available outside of your on-premises network.


### Azure classic portal configuration

1. Publish your application according to the instructions described in [Publish applications with Application Proxy](active-directory-application-proxy-publish.md).
2. In the list of applications, select the claims aware app and click **Configure**.
3. If you chose **Passthrough** as your **Preauthentication Method**, make sure to select **HTTPS** as your **External URL** scheme.
4. If you chose **Azure Active Directory** as your **Preauthentication Method**, select **None** as your **Internal Authentication Method**.


### ADFS configuration

1. Open ADFS Management.
2. Go to **Relying Party Trusts**, right click on the app you are publishing with Application Proxy, and choose **Properties**.

3. On the **Endpoints** tab, under **Endpoint type**, select **WS-Federation**.
4. Under **Trusted URL** enter the URL you entered in the Application Proxy under **External URL** and click **OK**.
