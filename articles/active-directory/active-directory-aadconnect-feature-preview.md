# More details about features in preview
This topic describes how to use features currently in preview.

## Directory extensions
Directory extensions allows you to extend the schema in Azure AD with your own attributes from on-premises Active Directory. This allows you to build LOB apps consuming attributes you continue to manage on-premises. These attributes can be consumed through [Azure AD Graph directory extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-directory-schema-extensions) or [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/). You can see the attributes available using [Azure AD Graph explorer](https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net) and [Microsoft Graph explorer](https://graphexplorer2.azurewebsites.net/) respectively.

At present no Office 365 workload will consume these attributes.

During installation of Azure AD Connect, an application will be registered where these attributes will be available. You can see this application in the Azure portal.

These attributes will now be available through Graph:
![Graph](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-feature-preview/extension4.png)

The attributes are prefixed with extension\_{AppClientId}\_. The AppClientId will have the same value for all attributes in your Azure AD directory.

Only single-valued attributes are supported and the values in the attributes cannot be longer than 250 characters.

## Group writeback
The option for group writeback in optional features will allow you to writeback “Office 365 Groups” to a forest with Exchange installed. This is a group which is always mastered in the cloud. If you have Exchange on-premises then you can write back these groups to on-premises so users with an on-premises Exchange mailbox can send and receive emails from these groups.

More information about Office 365 Groups and how to use them can be found [here](http://aka.ms/O365g).

This group will be represented as a distribution group in on-premises AD DS. Your on-premises Exchange server must be on Exchange 2013 cumulative update 8 (released in March 2015) or Exchange 2016 to recognize this new group type.

**Notes during the preview**

- The address book attribute is currently not populated in the preview. Without this attribute, the group will not be visible in the GAL. The easiest way to populate this attribute is to use the Exchange PowerShell cmdlet `update-recipient`.
- Only forests with the Exchange schema are valid targets for groups. If no Exchange was detected, then group writeback will not be possible to enable.
- Only single-forest Exchange organization deployments are currently supported. If you have more than one Exchange organization on-premises, then you will need an on-premises GALSync solution for these groups to appear in your other forests.
- The Group writeback feature does not currently handle security groups or distribution groups.

>[AZURE.NOTE] A subscription to Azure AD Premium is required for group writeback.

## User writeback
> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The user writeback preview feature was temporarily removed in the August 2015 update to Azure AD Connect. If you have enabled it, then you should disable this feature.

User writeback is in early preview. It can only be used when Azure AD is the source for all user objects and on-premises Active Directory is empty before you enable the feature (green-field deployment).

> [AZURE.WARNING] This feature should only be evaluated in a test environment and should not be used in an Azure AD directory used for production usage.
