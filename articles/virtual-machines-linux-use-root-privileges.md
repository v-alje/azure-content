#Using root privileges on Linux virtual machines in Windows Azure

You can gain root priviliges on your Linux virtual machine using one of the following methods, depending on how you provisioned your virtual machine.

1. **Uploaded an SSH Key** - when provisioning the virtual machine, you uploaded a certificate (`.CER` file) as well as a user name and password.
2. **User name and password only** - when provisioning the virtual machine, you only provided a user name and password; **No** SSH Key.


##Uploaded an SSH key

Once you are already logged into your virtual machine using the SSH Key, you can run commands using `sudo`, an example:

	sudo chmod +x myscript.py

You will be prompted for a password when this occurs. Put in the password you provided when provisioning the machine.

**Note:** The password is still required even when using an SSH Key. This may cause issues with certain scripts and tools, so make sure they can support challenged `sudo` commands.


##User name and password

Once you are already logged into your virtual machine using your user name and password, you can run commands using `sudo`, an example:

	sudo chmod +x myscript.py

You will be prompted for a password when this occurs. Put in the password you provided when provisioning the machine.
