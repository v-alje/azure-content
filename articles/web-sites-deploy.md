FTP is the most ubiquitous publishing protocol, predating the web itself. When you create a web site, you can create FTP credentials and use any standard FTP application, including Internet Explorer itself, to push or pull content. There are quite a few tools and techniques that allow you to [script](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/96269) or [automate](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/96269) using FTP.
