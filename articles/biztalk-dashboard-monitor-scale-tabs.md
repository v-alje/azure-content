# BizTalk Services: Dashboard, Monitor and Scale tabs

The first time you open the Windows Azure Management Portal, you are automatically placed at the **ALL ITEMS** tab. The columns in the **ALL ITEMS** tab can be sorted. To view your BizTalk Service, select your BizTalk Service in the **ALL ITEMS** tab or click the **BIZTALK SERVICES** tab; and then click your BizTalk Service name.

This opens a new window with the following options:

- [Quick Start](#QuickStart)

- [Dashboard](#Dashboard)

- [Monitor](#Monitor)

- [Scale](#Scale)

This topic describes these tabs.


##<a name="QuickStart"></a>Quick Start
In the Quick Start tab, you can do the following:

In the task bar at the bottom, you can **Manage** the BizTalk Service, view the Access Control Namespace **Connection Information**, **Sync Keys** of the Storage Account, or **Delete** the BizTalk Service:


<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="FAF9F9">
        <td><strong>Option</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manage</td>
<td>When you click Manage, the Windows Azure BizTalk Services Portal opens. The BizTalk Services Portal is the entrance to EDI configuration, including adding partners and creating AS2 and X12 agreements.
<br/><br/>
This is the same as <strong>Create partner agreements</strong> on the <strong>Quick Start</strong> tab.

<td>When you click Connection Information, the Access Control Namespace, Default Issuer, and Default Key are displayed. You can copy these values.
<br/><br/>
You can also open the Access Control Management Portal. This Access Control Mangement Portal is the same as using the Active Directory option in the left navigation pane.

<a HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=285670">Managing Your ACS Namespace</a> provides more information on the Access Control Management Portal.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Sync Keys</td>
<td>When you create a Storage account, a Primary Key and Secondary Key are automatically created. These Keys control access to your Storage Account. Your BizTalk Service automatically uses the Primary Key. <strong>Sync Keys</strong> enable users to switch between the Primary Key and the Secondary Key without disrupting the BizTalk Service.
<br/><br/>
For example, you want the BizTalk Service to use a new Primary Key for the Storage Account. To do this:
<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Click your BizTalk Service and click <strong>Sync Keys</strong>. Select the Secondary Key. When you do this, the BizTalk Service starts using the Secondary Key.</li>
<li>In the Windows Azure Management Portal, click your Storage account and Regenerate the Primary Key. Remember, your BizTalk Service is using the Secondary Key.</li>
<li>Click your BizTalk Service and click <strong>Sync Keys</strong>. Now, select the Primary Key. This is the new Primary Key you regenerated.</li>
<li>In the Windows Azure Management Portal, click your Storage account and Regenerate the Secondary Key.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
This process is called "rollover keys". The purpose is to enable users to switch between the Primary Key and the Secondary Key without disrupting the BizTalk Service.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delete</td>
<td>When you click Delete, your BizTalk Service and all items deployed to it are removed.</td>
</tr>
</table>


##<a name="Dashboard"></a>Dashboard

![CPU Usage metric is grayed out][GrayedMetric]
<br/>
Click the grayed out circle to enable the **CPU Usage** metric to display its output in the graph:<br/>
![CPU Usage metric is enabled][EnabledMetric]

>6. To remove a metric from the display graph and the list, click **Delete Metric** in the task bar. Clicking **Delete Metric** removes the metric from the Monitor tab. To add the metric back to the list, click **Add Metrics** in the task bar, check the metric, and click the checkmark to return to the **Monitor** tab. Click the grayed out circle to enable the metric in the graph.

##<a name="Metrics"></a>Available Metrics
The following performance counters/metrics are available:

<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="FAF9F9">
<td><strong>Metric</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RountdTrip Latency</td>
<td>In milliseconds (ms), this performance metric displays the average time taken to process a message from the time it is received until it is fully processed by the BizTalk Service across all bridges. Only messages successfully processed are counted.<br/><br/>
When the following events occur, a timestamp is created:
<ul>
<li>Message enters the gateway</li>
<li>Message is routed to the destination</li>
<li>Destination response is received</li>
<li>Destination acknowledgement response sent to the gateway</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This metric shows the result of the following calculation:
<br/><br/>
[Destination acknowledgement response sent to the gateway] - [Message enters the gateway]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failures At Source</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages that failed by the BizTalk Service when pulling messages from the source endpoints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU Usage</td>
<td>Lists the average %Processor Time of all role instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processing Latency</td>
<td>In milliseconds (ms), this performance metric displays the average time taken to process a message by the BizTalk Service across all bridges, excluding the time spent in destinations. Only messages successfully processed are counted.<br/><br/>
When each of the following events occur, a timestamp is created:

<ul>
<li>Message enters the gateway</li>
<li>Message is routed to the destination</li>
<li>Destination response is received</li>
<li>Destination acknowledgement response sent to the gateway</li>
</ul>
<br/>This metric shows the result of the following calculation:<br/><br/>
[Destination acknowledgement response sent to the gateway] - [Message enters the gateway] - [Destination response is received] + [Message is routed to the destination]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failures In Process</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages that failed during processing by the BizTalk Service across all the bridges within a time interval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Messages Sent</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages sent by the BizTalk Service across all bridges within a time interval. This metric is incremented when a message sent from a pipeline reaches the route destination. This metric does not indicate that a message is successfully processed.<br/><br/>
In a Request-Reply scenario, the metric is incremented when the route destination sends a receipt acknowledgement back to the pipeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Messages Received</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages received by the BizTalk Service across all bridges within a time interval. This metric is incremented when a new message is received by the pipeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Messages In Process</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages currently being processed by the BizTalk Service within a time interval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Messages Processed</td>
<td>A performance metric that displays the total number of messages successfully processed by the BizTalk Service across all bridges within a time interval. This metric is incremented when a message is successfully received by the pipeline and successfully routed to the destination.</td>
</tr>
</table>


##<a name="Scale"></a>Scale
In the Scale tab, you can add or subtract the number of units used by your BizTalk Service. By default, there is one Unit configured. Additional Units can be added to scale your BizTalk Service. When you increase the scale, you are increasing throughput. The amount of resources also increases, including deployed bridges, agreements, LOB connections, and processing power. For example, you increase the scale from 1 Unit to 2 Units. In this situation, you can deploy double the number of bridges, double the agreements, double the LOB connections, and double the processing power.

Some BizTalk editions do not offer a scale option. In this situation, one Unit is permitted. To determine how many units your edition can be scaled, refer to [BizTalk Services: Developer, Basic, Standard and Premium Editions Chart](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=302279).

Increasing the number of units may impact pricing. If you increase the Units, clicking **Save** displays a message that tells you if billing is impacted. You then choose to continue. When you increase the number of Units, the BizTalk Service status changes from Active to Updating. In the Updating state, your BizTalk Service continues to run.
