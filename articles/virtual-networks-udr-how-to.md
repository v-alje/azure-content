# How to Create Routes and Enable IP Forwarding in Azure
You can use virtual appliances in Azure to handle traffic in your Azure virtual network. However, you need to create routes that will allow VMs and cloud services in your virtual network to send packets to your virtual appliance, instead of the desired destination for the packet. You also need to enable IP forwarding on the virtual appliance VM so it can receive and forward packets that are not addressed to the actual virtual appliance VM. 

##How to manage routes
You can add, remove, and change routes in Azure by using PowerShell. Before you can create a route, you must create a route table to host the route.

### How to create a route table
To create a route table named *FrontEndSubnetRouteTable*, run the following PowerShell command:

	New-AzureRouteTable -Name FrontEndSubnetRouteTable `
	-Location usnorth `
	-Label "Route table for frontend subnet"

### How to add a route to a route table
To add a route that sets *10.1.1.10* as the next hop for the *10.2.0.0/16* subnet in the route table created above, run the following PowerShell command:

	Set-AzureRoute -RouteTableName FrontEndSubnetRouteTable `
	-RouteName FirewallRoute -AddressPrefix 10.2.0.0/16 `
	-NextHopType VirtualAppliance `
	-NextHopIpAddress 10.1.1.10

### How to associate a route to a subnet
A route table must be associated with one or more subnets for it to be used. To associate the *FrontEndSubnetRouteTable* route table to a subnet named *FrontEndSubnet* in the virtual network *ProductionVnet*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Set-AzureSubnetRouteTable -VNetName ProductionVnet `
	-SubnetName FrontEndSubnet `
	-RouteTableName FrontEndSubnetRouteTable

### How to see the applied routes in a VM
You can query Azure to see the actual routes applied for a specific VM or role instance. The routes shown include default routes that Azure provides, as well as routes advertised by a VPN Gateway. The limit of routes shown is 800.

To see routes associated to the primary NIC on a VM named *FirewallAppliance1*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureVM -Name FirewallAppliance1 `
	| Get-AzureEffectiveRouteTable

To see routes associated to a secondary NIC named *backendnic* on a VM named *FirewallAppliance1*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureVM -Name FirewallAppliance1 `
	| Get-AzureEffectiveRouteTable -NetworkInterfaceName backendnic

To see routes associated to the primary NIC on a role instance named *myRole* that is part of a cloud service named *myservice*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureEffectiveRouteTable -ServiceName myservice `
	-RoleInstanceName myRole

## How to Manage IP Forwarding
As previously mentioned, you need to enable IP forwarding on any VM or role instance that will act as a virtual appliance. 

### How to enable IP Forwarding
To enable IP forwarding in a VM named *FirewallAppliance1*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureVM -Name FirewallAppliance1 `
	| Set-AzureIPForwarding -Enable

To enable IP forwarding in a role instance named *FirewallAppliance1* in a cloud service named *myService*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Set-AzureIPForwarding -ServiceName myService `
	-RoleName FirewallAppliance1 -Enable

### How to disable IP Forwarding
To disable IP forwarding in a VM named *FirewallAppliance1*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureVM -Name FirewallAppliance1 `
	| Set-AzureIPForwarding -Disable

To disable IP forwarding in a role instance named *FirewallAppliance1* in a cloud service named *myService*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Set-AzureIPForwarding -ServiceName myService `
	-RoleName FirewallAppliance1 -Disable

### How to view status of IP Forwarding
To view the status of IP forwarding on a VM named *FirewallAppliance1*, run the following PowerShell command:

	Get-AzureVM -Name FirewallAppliance1 `
	| Get-AzureIPForwarding
