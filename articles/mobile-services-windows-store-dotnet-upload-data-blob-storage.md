This topic shows you how to use Windows Azure Mobile Services to enable your app to upload and store user-generated images in Windows Azure Storage. Mobile Services uses a SQL Database to store data. However, binary large object (BLOB) data is more efficiently stored in Windows Azure Blob storage service. 

You cannot securely distribute with the client app the credentials required to securely upload data to the Blob Storage service. Instead, you must store these credentials in server scripts and use them to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) that is used to upload a new image. The SAS, a credential with a short expiration--in this case 5 minutes, is returned securely by Mobile Services to the client app. The app then uses this temporary credential to upload the image. In this example, downloads from the Blob service are public.

In this tutorial you add functionality to the Mobile Services quickstart app to take pictures and upload the images to Windows Azure by using an SAS generated by Mobile Services. This tutorial walks you through the following basic steps to update the Mobile Services quickstart to upload images to the Blob Storage service:

1. [Install the Storage Client library]
2. [Update the insert script to generate an SAS]
3. [Update the client app to capture images]
4. [Upload images to test the app]

This tutorial requires the following:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, or a later version
+ [Windows Azure Storage account][How To Create a Storage Account]
+ A camera or other image capture device attached to your computer.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

<h2><a name="install-storage-client"></a><span class="short-header">Install Storage client</span>Install the Storage client for Windows Store apps</h2>

To be able to use an SAS to upload images to Blob storage, you must first add the NuGet package that installs Storage client library for Windows Store apps.

1. In **Solution Explorer** in Visual Studio, right-click the project name, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

2. In the left pane, select the **Online** category, select **Include Prerelease**, search for `WindowsAzure.Storage-Preview`, click **Install** on the **Windows Azure Storage** package, then accept the license agreements. 

  	![][2]

  	This adds the client library for Windows Azure storage services to the project.

Next, you will update the quickstart app to capture and upload images.

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the insert script</span>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-configure-blob-storage](../includes/mobile-services-configure-blob-storage.md)]

<h2><a name="add-select-images"></a><span class="short-header">Update the app</span>Update the quickstart client app to capture and upload images</h2>

1. In Visual Studio 2012, open the Package.appxmanifest file and in the **Capabilities** tab enable the **Webcam** and **Microphone** capabilities.

   	![][5]

   	This makes sure that your app can use a camera attached to the computer. Users will be requested to allow camera access the first time that the app is run.

1. Open the MainPage.xaml file and replace the **StackPanel** element directly after the first **Task** element with the following code:

        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="72,0,0,0">
            <TextBox Name="TextInput" Margin="5" MaxHeight="40" MinWidth="300"></TextBox>
            <Button Name="btnTakePhoto" Style="{StaticResource PhotoAppBarButtonStyle}"
                    Click="OnTakePhotoClick" />
            <Button Name="ButtonSave" Style="{StaticResource UploadAppBarButtonStyle}" 
                    Click="ButtonSave_Click"/>
        </StackPanel>

2. Replace the **StackPanel** element in the **DataTemplate** with the following code:

        <StackPanel Orientation="Vertical">
            <CheckBox Name="CheckBoxComplete" IsChecked="{Binding Complete, Mode=TwoWay}" 
                        Checked="CheckBoxComplete_Checked" Content="{Binding Text}" 
                        Margin="10,5" VerticalAlignment="Center"/>
            <Image Name="ImageUpload" Source="{Binding ImageUri, Mode=OneWay}"
                    MaxHeight="250"/>
        </StackPanel> 

   	This adds an image to the **ItemTemplate** and sets its binding source as the URI of the uploaded image in the Blob Storage service.

3. Open the MainPage.xaml.cs project file and add the following **using** statements:
	
		using Windows.Media.Capture;
		using Windows.Storage;
		using Windows.UI.Popups;
		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Auth;
		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;
    
4. In the TodoItem class, add the following properties:

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "containerName")]
        public string ContainerName { get; set; }
		
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "resourceName")]
        public string ResourceName { get; set; }
		
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "sasQueryString")]
        public string SasQueryString { get; set; }
		
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "imageUri")]
        public string ImageUri { get; set; } 

   	<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
   		<p>To add new properties to the TodoItem object, you must have Dynamic Schema enabled in your mobile service. When Dynamic Schema is enabled, new columns are automatically added to the TodoItem table that map to these new properties.</p>
   	</div>

5. In the MainPage class, add the following code:

        // Use a StorageFile to hold the captured image for upload.
        StorageFile media = null;
		
		private async void OnTakePhotoClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
		{
			// Capture a new photo or video from the device.
			CameraCaptureUI cameraCapture = new CameraCaptureUI();
			media = await cameraCapture
				.CaptureFileAsync(CameraCaptureUIMode.PhotoOrVideo);
        }

  	This code displays the camera UI to capture an image, and saves the image to a storage file.

6. Replace the existing `InsertTodoItem` method with the following code:
 
        private async void InsertTodoItem(TodoItem todoItem)
        {
            string errorString = string.Empty;
			
            if (media != null)
            {
                // Set blob properties of TodoItem.
                todoItem.ContainerName = "todoitemimages";
                todoItem.ResourceName = media.Name;
            }
			
            // Send the item to be inserted. When blob properties are set this
            // generates an SAS in the response.
            await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);
			
            // If we have a returned SAS, then upload the blob.
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(todoItem.SasQueryString))
            {
                // Get the new image as a stream.
                using (var fileStream = await media.OpenStreamForReadAsync())
                {                   
                    // Get the URI generated that contains the SAS 
                    // and extract the storage credentials.
                    StorageCredentials cred = new StorageCredentials(todoItem.SasQueryString);
                    var imageUri = new Uri(todoItem.ImageUri);
					
                    // Instantiate a Blob store container based on the info in the returned item.
                    CloudBlobContainer container = new CloudBlobContainer(
                        new Uri(string.Format("https://{0}/{1}",
                            imageUri.Host, todoItem.ContainerName)), cred);
					
                    // Upload the new image as a BLOB from the stream.
                    CloudBlockBlob blobFromSASCredential =
                        container.GetBlockBlobReference(todoItem.ResourceName);
                    await blobFromSASCredential.UploadFromStreamAsync(fileStream.AsInputStream());
                }
            }
			
            // Add the new item to the collection.
            items.Add(todoItem);
        }

	This code sends a request to the mobile service to insert a new TodoItem, including the image file name. The response contains the SAS, which is then used to insert the image in the Blob store, and the URI of the image for data binding.

The final step is to test the app and validate that uploads succeed.
		
<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test uploading the images in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. Enter text in the textbox under **Insert a TodoItem**, then click **Photo**.

   	![][6]

  	This displays the camera capture UI. 

3. Click the image to take a picture, then click **OK**.
  
   	![][7]

4. Click **Upload** to insert the new item and upload the image.

	![][8]

5. The new item, along with the uploaded image, is displayed in the list view.

	![][9]

   	<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
   		<p>The image is downloaded automatically from the Blob Storage service when the <code>imageUri</code> property of the new item is bound to the <strong>Image</strong> control.</p>
   	</div>
