# How to publish an offer to the Azure Marketplace
This article is provided to help a developer create and deploy a solution to the Azure Marketplace for other Azure customers and partners to purchase and utilize.

The first thing you would want to do as a publisher is to define what kind of solution your company is offering. The Azure Marketplace supports multiple solutions, and each of them requires a slightly different set of work from you in order to successfully publish into the Marketplace.

Types of solutions:

- Virtual machine image
- Developer service
- Data service
- Solution template

Some steps are shared between the different types of solutions. This article provides a short overview of what steps you will need to complete for any type of solution.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Before you begin any work on the Azure Marketplace, you must be pre-approved. This is not applicable for data service publishers.
