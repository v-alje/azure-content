# Azure Active Directory Developer's Guide

<a name='overview'></a>
## Overview

_Read these overview topics to learn the basics of Azure Active Directory, or jump to [getting started](#getting-started)._

Azure Active Directory offers developers an effective way to integrate identity management in their applications. Industry standard protocols such as SAML 2.0, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect makes sign-in possible on a variety of platforms such as .Net, Java, Node.js, and PHP. The REST-based Graph API enables developers to read and write to the directory from any platform. Through support for OAuth 2.0, developers can build mobile and web applications that integrate with Microsoft and third party web APIs, and build their own secure web APIs. Open source client libraries are available for .Net, Windows Store, iOS and Android with additional libraries under development.

These articles provide developers with high-level information about the use, implementation, and key features of Azure Active Directory. We suggest you read them in order.

## Scenarios

Each of the scenarios below can be developed using various languages and platforms, and there are complete code samples available on GitHub for each. In addition, if your application needs a specific piece or segment of an end-to-end scenario, in most cases that functionality can be added independently. For example, if you have a native application that calls a web API, you can easily add a web application that also calls the web API.

The following diagram illustrates these scenarios and application types, and how different components can be added:

![Application Types and scenarios](./media/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/application_types_and_scenarios.png)

These are the five primary application scenarios supported by Azure AD:

- [Web Browser to Web Application][]: A user needs to sign in to a web application that is secured by Azure AD.

- [Single Page Application (SPA)][]: A user needs to sign in to a single page application that is secured by Azure AD.

- [Native Application to Web API][]: A native application that runs on a phone, tablet, or PC needs to authenticate a user to get resources from a web API that is secured by Azure AD.

- [Web Application to Web API][]: A web application needs to get resources from a web API secured by Azure AD.

- [Daemon or Server Application to Web API][]: A daemon application or a server application with no web user interface needs to get resources from a web API secured by Azure AD.
