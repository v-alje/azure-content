#<a name="heading"></a>Sample data in the Cortana Analytics Process

This **menu** links to topics that describe how to sample data from various storage environments. This task is a step in the Cortana Analytics Process (CAP).

## Introduction

This document covers sampling data stored in Azure blob storage by downloading it programmatically and then sampling it with sample Python code. The steps to do so are as follows:

This document covers how to sample data that is stored three locations typically used in the Cortana Analytics Process:

- **Azure blob container data** is sampled by downloading it programmatically and then sampling it with sample Python code.
- **SQL Server data** is sampled using both SQL and the Python Programming Language. 
- **Hive table data** is sampled using Hive queries.
