# Using the Windows Azure Import/Export Service to Transfer Data to Blob Storage

You can use the Windows Azure Import/Export service to transfer large amounts of file data to Windows Azure Blob storage in situations where uploading over the network is prohibitively expensive or not feasible. You can also use the Import/Export service to transfer large quantities of data resident in Blob storage to your on-premises installations in a timely and cost-effective manner.

To transfer a large set of file data into Blob storage, you can send one or more hard drives containing that data to a Windows Azure data center, where your data will be uploaded to your storage account. Similarly, to export data from Blob storage, you can send empty hard drives to a Windows Azure data center, where the Blob data from your storage account will be copied to your hard drives and then returned to you. Before you send in a drive that contains data, you'll encrypt the data on the drive; when the Import/Export service exports your data to send to you, the data will also be encrypted before shipping.

You can create and manage import and export jobs in one of two ways:

- By using the Windows Azure Management Portal.
- By using a REST interface to the service.

This article provides an overview of the Import/Export service and describes how to use the Management Portal to work with the Import/Export service. For information on the REST API, see the [Windows Azure Import/Export Service REST API Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=329099).

## Overview of the Import/Export Service ##

To begin the process of importing to or exporting from Blob storage, you first create a *job*. A job can be an *import job* or an *export job*:

- Create an import job when you want to transfer data you have on-premise to blobs in your Windows Azure storage account.
- Create an export job when you want to transfer data currently stored as blobs in your storage account to hard drives that are shipped to you.

When you create a job, you notify the Import/Export service that you will be shipping one or more hard drives to a Windows Azure data center. For an import job, you'll be shipping hard drives containing file data. For an export job, you'll be shipping empty hard drives.

To prepare your drive to ship for an import job, you'll run the **WAImportExport** tool, which facilitates copying your data to the drive, encrypting the data on the drive with BitLocker, and generating the drive journal files, which are discussed below.

<div class="dev-callout">
<strong>Note</strong>
<p>The data on the drive must be encrypted using BitLocker Drive Encryption. This protects your data while it is in transit. For an export job, the Import/Export service will encrypt your data before shipping the drive back to you.</p>
</div>

When you create an import job or an export job, you'll also need the *drive ID*, which is the serial number assigned by the drive manufacturer to a specific hard disk. The drive ID is displayed on the exterior of the drive. 

<h3>Requirements and Scope</h3>

1.	**Subscription and storage accounts:** You must have an existing Windows Azure subscription and one or more storage accounts to use the Import/Export service. Each job may be used to transfer data to or from only one storage account. In other words, a job cannot span across multiple storage accounts. For information on creating a new storage account, see [How to Create a Storage Account](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/storage/how-to-create-a-storage-account/).
2.	**Hard drives:** Only 3.5 inch SATA II hard drives are supported for use with the Import/Export service. Hard drives above 4TB are not supported with the preview release. For import jobs, only the first data volume on the drive will be processed. The data volume must be formatted with NTFS. You can attach a SATA II disk externally to most computers using a SATA II USB Adapter.
3.	**BitLocker encryption:** All data stored on hard drives must be encrypted using BitLocker with encryption keys protected with numerical passwords.
4.	**Blob storage targets:** Data may be uploaded to or downloaded from block blobs and page blobs. 
5.	**Number of jobs:** A customer may have up to 20 jobs active per subscription.
6.	**Maximum size of a job:** The size of a job is determined by the capacity of the hard drives used and the maximum amount of data that can be stored in a storage account. Each job may contain no more than 10 hard drives.

## Create an Import Job in the Management Portal##

Create an import job to notify the Import/Export service that you'll be shipping one or more drives containing data to the data center to be imported into your storage account.

<h3>Prepare Your Drives</h3>

Before you create an import job, prepare your drives with the [WAImportExport tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=301900&clcid=0x409). For more details about using the WAImportExport tool, see [WAImportExport Tool Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=329032).
  
To prepare your drives, follow these three steps: 

1.	Determine the data to be imported, and the number of drives you'll need.
2.	Identify the destination blobs for your data in the Windows Azure Blob service.
3.	Use the WAImportExport tool to copy your data to one or more hard drives.

The WAImportExport tool generates a *drive journal* file for each drive as it is prepared. The drive journal file is stored on your local computer, not on the drive itself. You'll upload the journal file when you create the import job. A drive journal file includes the drive ID and the BitLocker key, as well as other information about the drive.  

<h3>Create the Import Job</h3>

1.	Once you have prepared your drive, navigate to your storage account in the Management Portal, and view the 	Dashboard. Under <strong>Quick Glance</strong>, click <strong>Create an Import Job</strong>. 
 
2.	In Step 1 of the wizard, indicate that you have prepared your drive and that you have the drive journal file 	available.
 
3.	In Step 2, provide contact information for the person responsible for this import job. If you wish to save 	verbose log data for the import job, check the option to <strong>Save the verbose log in my 'waimportexport' 	blob container</strong>.

4.	In Step 3, upload the drive journal files that you obtained during the drive preparation step. You'll need 	to upload one file for each drive that you have prepared.

	![Create import job - Step 3][import-job-03]

5.	In Step 4, enter a descriptive name for the import job. Note that the name you enter may contain only 	lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, must start with a letter, and may not contain spaces. 	You'll use the name you choose to track your jobs while they are in progress and once they are completed.

	The data center region will indicate the data center to which you must ship your package. See the FAQ below for more information.

	If you already have your FedEx tracking number, select <strong>I have my tracking number and want to enter it now</strong>, and navigate to the next step. If you do not have a tracking number yet, choose <strong>I will provide my shipping information for this import job once I have shipped my package</strong>, then complete the import process.

6. 	If you already have your tracking number, then in Step 5, enter the tracking number and confirm it. 

## Create an Export Job in the Management Portal##

Create an export job to notify the Import/Export service that you'll be shipping one or more empty drives to the data center, so that data can be exported from your storage account to the drives, and the drives then shipped to you.

1. 	To create an export job, navigate to your storage account in the Management Portal, and view the Dashboard. 	Under <strong>Quick Glance</strong>, click <strong>Create an Export Job</strong>, and proceed through the 	wizard.

2. 	In Step 2, provide contact information for the person responsible for this export job. If you wish to save 	verbose log data for the export job, check the option to <strong>Save the verbose log in my 'waimportexport' 	blob container</strong>.

3.	In Step 3, specify which blob data you wish to export from your storage account to your blank drive or 	drives. You can choose to export all blob data in the storage account, or you can specify which blobs 	or 	sets of blobs to export.

	![Create export job - Step 3][export-job-03]

	- To specify a blob to export, use the **Equal To** selector, and specify the relative path to the blob, beginning with the container name. Use *$root* to specify the root container.
	- To specify all blobs starting with a prefix, use the **Starts With** selector, and specify the prefix, beginning with a forward slash '/'. The prefix may be the prefix of the container name, the complete container name, or the complete container name followed by the prefix of the blob name.

	The table shows examples of valid blob paths:

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px solid #000000;">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Selector</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Blob Path</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starts With</td>
				<td>/</td>
				<td>Exports all blobs in the storage account</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starts With</td>
				<td>/$root/</td>
				<td>Exports all blobs in the root container</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starts With</td>
				<td>/book</td>
				<td>Exports all blobs in any container that begins with prefix <strong>book</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starts With</td>
				<td>/music/</td>
				<td>Exports all blobs in container <strong>music</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Starts With</td>
				<td>/music/love</td>
				<td>Exports all blobs in container <strong>music</strong> that begin with prefix <strong>love</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Equal To</td>
				<td>$root/logo.bmp</td>
				<td>Exports blob <strong>logo.bmp</strong> in the root container</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Equal To</td>
				<td>videos/story.mp4</td>
				<td>Exports blob <strong>story.mp4</strong> in container <strong>videos</strong></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>


4.	In Step 4, enter a descriptive name for the export job. The name you enter may contain only lowercase 	letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, must start with a letter, and may not contain spaces.

	The data center region will indicate the data center to which you must ship your package. See the FAQ below for more information.

	If you already have your FedEx tracking number, select <strong>I have my tracking number and want to enter it now</strong>, and navigate to the next step. If you do not have a tracking number yet, choose <strong>I will provide my shipping information for this export job once I have shipped my package</strong>, then complete the import process.

5. In Step 5, enter your tracking number, then confirm it. 


## Track Job Status in the Management Portal##

You can track the status of your import or export jobs from the Management Portal. Navigate to your storage account in the Management Portal, and click the **Import/Export** tab. A list of your jobs will appear on the page. You can filter the list on job status, job name, job type, or tracking number.

The table describes what each job status designation means:

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px solid #000000;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Job Status</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Creating</td>
			<td>Your job has been created, but you have not yet provided your shipping information.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shipping</td>
			<td>Your job has been created and you have provided your shipping information.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Transferring</td>
			<td>Your data is being transferred from your hard drive (for an import job) or to your hard drive (for an export job).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Packaging</td>
			<td>The transfer of your data is complete, and your hard drive is being prepared for shipping back to you.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Complete</td>
			<td>Your hard drive has been shipped back to you.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## View BitLocker Keys for an Export Job ##

For export jobs, you can view and copy the BitLocker keys generated by the service for your drive, so that you can decrypt your exported data once you receive the drives from the Windows Azure data center. Navigate to your storage account in the Management Portal, and click the **Import/Export** tab. Select your export job from the list, and click the **View Keys** button. The BitLocker keys appear as shown:
