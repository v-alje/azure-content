# Creating an Azure AD Tenant or an Azure AD B2C Tenant - Issues & Resolutions

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

## Creating an Azure AD Tenant

If you can't create an Azure AD tenant the first time, please try again. If the problem persists, contact Support.

## Creating an Azure AD B2C Tenant (preview)

If you encounter issues during the [creation of an Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md), try the following:

- If the Azure AD B2C tenant doesn't show up in your list of tenants, please try again.
- If the Azure AD B2C tenant does show up in your list of tenants, but you see an error message that says, "Could not complete the creation of the B2C tenant 'contosob2c'. Please visit this [link](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=624192&clcid=0x409) for more guidance.", then delete the tenant just created and try again.
- If none of the above resolutions work for you, contact Support. Read [this article](active-directory-b2c-support.md) on how to file support requests for Azure AD B2C.
