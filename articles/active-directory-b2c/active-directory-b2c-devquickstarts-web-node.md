# B2C Preview: Add sign-in to a nodeJS Web App


[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

> [AZURE.NOTE]
	This article does not cover how to implement sign-in, sign-up and profile management with Azure AD B2C.  It focuses on calling web APIs after the user is already authenticated.
If you haven't already, you should start with the [.NET Web App getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md) to learn about the basics of Azure AD B2C.

**Passport** is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Resitify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. We have developed a strategy for Microsoft Azure Active Directory. We will install this module and then add the Microsoft Azure Active Directory `passport-azure-ad` plug-in.

In order to do this, you’ll need to:

1. Register an application with Azure AD
2. Set up your app to use Passport's azure-ad-passport plug-in.
3. Use Passport to issue sign-in and sign-out requests to Azure AD.
4. Print out data about the user.

The code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS).  To follow along, you can [download the app's skeleton as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS/archive/skeleton.zip) or clone the skeleton:

```git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS.git```

The completed application is provided at the end of this tutorial as well.

> [AZURE.WARNING] 	For our B2C Preview you must use the same client ID/Application ID and policies for both the Web-API task server and the client that connects to it. This is true for our iOS and Android tutorials. If you have previously created an application in either of those quickstarts, please use those values instead of creating new ones below.

## 1. Get an Azure AD B2C directory

Before you can use Azure AD B2C, you must create a directory, or tenant.  A directory is a container for all your users, apps, groups, and so on.  If you don't have
one already, go [create a B2C directory](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) before moving on.

## 2. Create an application

Now you need to create an app in your B2C directory, which gives Azure AD some information that it needs to securely communicate with your app.  Both the client app and web API will be represented by a single **Application ID** in this case, since they comprise one logical app.  To create an app,
follow [these instructions](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md).  Be sure to

- Include a **web app/web api** in the application
- Enter `http://localhost/TodoListService` as a **Reply URL** - it is the default URL for this code sample.
- Create an **Application Secret** for your application and copy it down.  You will need it shortly.
- Copy down the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app.  You will also need it shortly.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## 3. Create your policies

In Azure AD B2C, every user experience is defined by a [**policy**](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md).  This app contains three
identity experiences - sign-up, sign-in, and sign-in with Facebook.  You will need to create one policy of each type, as described in the
[policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md#how-to-create-a-sign-up-policy).  When creating your three policies, be sure to:

- Choose the **Display Name** and a few other sign-up attributes in your sign-up policy.
- Choose the **Display Name** and **Object ID** application claims in every policy.  You can choose other claims as well.
- Copy down the **Name** of each policy after you create it.  It should have the prefix `b2c_1_`.  You'll need those policy names shortly.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy.md)]

Once you have your three policies successfully created, you're ready to build your app.

Note that this article does not cover how to use the policies you just created.  If you want to learn about how policies work in Azure AD B2C,
you should start with the [.NET Web App getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md).



## 4. Add pre-requisities to your directory

From the command-line, change directories to your root folder if not already there and run the following commands:

- `npm install express`
- `npm install ejs`
- `npm install ejs-locals`
- `npm install restify`
- `npm install mongoose`
- `npm install bunyan`
- `npm install assert-plus`
- `npm install passport`
- `npm install webfinger`
- `npm install body-parser`
- `npm install express-session`
- `npm install cookie-parser`

- In addition, we've use `passport-azure-ad` for our Preview in the skeleton of the quickstart.

- `npm install passport-azure-ad`


This will install the libraries that passport-azure-ad depend on.

## 5. Set up your app to use the passport-node-js strategy
Here, we'll configure the Express middleware to use the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  Passport will be used to issue sign-in and sign-out requests, manage the user's session, and get information about the user, amongst other things.

-	To begin, open the `config.js` file in the root of the project, and enter your app's configuration values in the `exports.creds` section.
    -	The `clientID:` is the **Application Id** assigned to your app in the registration portal.
    -	The `returnURL` is the **Redirect URI** you entered in the portal.
    - The `tenantName:` is the **tenant name** of your app, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]

- Next open `app.js` file in the root of the proejct and add the follwing call to invoke the `OIDCStrategy` strategy that comes with `passport-azure-ad`


```JavaScript
var OIDCStrategy = require('passport-azure-ad').OIDCStrategy;

// Add some logging
var log = bunyan.createLogger({
    name: 'Microsoft OIDC Example Web Application'
});
```

- After that, use the strategy we just referenced to handle our login requests

```JavaScript
// Use the OIDCStrategy within Passport. (Section 2)
//
//   Strategies in passport require a `validate` function, which accept
//   credentials (in this case, an OpenID identifier), and invoke a callback
//   with a user object.
passport.use(new OIDCStrategy({
    callbackURL: config.creds.returnURL,
    realm: config.creds.realm,
    clientID: config.creds.clientID,
    oidcIssuer: config.creds.issuer,
    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
    skipUserProfile: config.creds.skipUserProfile,
    responseType: config.creds.responseType,
    responseMode: config.creds.responseMode,
    tenantName: config.creds.tenantName
  },
  function(iss, sub, profile, accessToken, refreshToken, done) {
    log.info('Example: Email address we received was: ', profile.email);
    // asynchronous verification, for effect...
    process.nextTick(function () {
      findByEmail(profile.email, function(err, user) {
        if (err) {
          return done(err);
        }
        if (!user) {
          // "Auto-registration"
          users.push(profile);
          return done(null, profile);
        }
        return done(null, user);
      });
    });
  }
));
```
Passport uses a similar pattern for all it’s Strategies (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) that all Strategy writers adhere to. Looking at the strategy you see we pass it a function() that has a token and a done as the parameters. The strategy will dutifully come back to us once it does all it’s work. Once it does we’ll want to store the user and stash the token so we won’t need to ask for it again.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
The code above takes any user that happens to authenticate to our server. This is known as auto registration. In production servers you wouldn’t want to let anyone in without first having them go through a registration process you decide. This is usually the pattern you see in consumer apps who allow you to register with Facebook but then ask you to fill out additional information. If this wasn’t a sample application, we could have just extracted the email from the token object that is returned and then asked them to fill out additional information. Since this is a test server we simply add them to the in-memory database.

- Next, let's add the methods that will allow us to keep track of the logged in users as required by Passport. This includes serializing and deserializing the user's information:

```JavaScript

// Passport session setup. (Section 2)

//   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to
//   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  Typically,
//   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding
//   the user by ID when deserializing.
passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
  done(null, user.email);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {
  findByEmail(id, function (err, user) {
    done(err, user);
  });
});

// array to hold logged in users
var users = [];

var findByEmail = function(email, fn) {
  for (var i = 0, len = users.length; i < len; i++) {
    var user = users[i];
    log.info('we are using user: ', user);
    if (user.email === email) {
      return fn(null, user);
    }
  }
  return fn(null, null);
};

```

- Next, let's add the code to load the express engine. Here you see we use the default /views and /routes pattern that Express provides.

```JavaScript

// configure Express (Section 2)

var app = express();


app.configure(function() {
  app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
  app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
  app.use(express.logger());
  app.use(express.methodOverride());
  app.use(cookieParser());
  app.use(expressSession({ secret: 'keyboard cat', resave: true, saveUninitialized: false }));
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended : true }));
  // Initialize Passport!  Also use passport.session() middleware, to support
  // persistent login sessions (recommended).
  app.use(passport.initialize());
  app.use(passport.session());
  app.use(app.router);
  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../../public'));
});

```

- Finally, let's add the POST routes that will hand off the actual login requests to the `passport-azure-ad` engine:

```JavaScript

// Our Auth routes (Section 3)

// GET /auth/openid
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  The first step in OpenID authentication will involve redirecting
//   the user to their OpenID provider.  After authenticating, the OpenID
//   provider will redirect the user back to this application at
//   /auth/openid/return

app.get('/auth/openid',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    log.info('Authenitcation was called in the Sample');
    res.redirect('/');
  });

// GET /auth/openid/return
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the
//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,
//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.
app.get('/auth/openid/return',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {

    res.redirect('/');
  });

// POST /auth/openid/return
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the
//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,
//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.

app.post('/auth/openid/return',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {

    res.redirect('/');
  });
```

## 4. Use Passport to issue sign-in and sign-out requests to Azure AD

Your app is now properly configured to communicate with the v2.0 endpoint using the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  `passport-azure-ad` has taken care of all of the ugly details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session.  All that remains is to give your users a way to sign in, sign out, and gather additional info on the logged in user.

- First, lets add the default, login, account, and logout methods to our `app.js` file:

```JavaScript

//Routes (Section 4)

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.render('index', { user: req.user });
});

app.get('/account', ensureAuthenticated, function(req, res){
  res.render('account', { user: req.user });
});

app.get('/login',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    log.info('Login was called in the Sample');
    res.redirect('/');
});

app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/');
});

```

-	Let's review these in detail:
    -	The `/` route will redirect to the index.ejs view passing the user in the request (if it exists)
    - The `/account` route will first ***ensure we are authenticated*** (we implement that below) and then pass the user in the request so that we can get additional information about the user.
    - The `/login` route will call our azuread-openidconnect authenticator from `passport-azuread` and if that doesn't succeed will redirect the user back to /login
    - The `/logout` will simply call the logout.ejs (and route) which clears cookies and then return the user back to index.ejs


- For the last part of `app.js`, let's add the EnsureAuthenticated method that is used in `/account` above.

```JavaScript

// Simple route middleware to ensure user is authenticated. (Section 4)

//   Use this route middleware on any resource that needs to be protected.  If
//   the request is authenticated (typically via a persistent login session),
//   the request will proceed.  Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the
//   login page.
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) { return next(); }
  res.redirect('/login')
}

```

- Finally, let's actually create the server itself in `app.js`:

```JavaScript

app.listen(3000);

```


## 5. Create the views and routes in express to call our policies

We have our `app.js` complete. Now we simply need to add the routes and views that will allow us to call the sign-in and sign-up policies the as well as handle the `/logout` and `/login` routes we've created.

- Create the `/routes/index.js` route under the root directory.

```JavaScript

/*
 * GET home page.
 */

exports.index = function(req, res){
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
};
```

- Create the `/routes/user.js` route under the root directory

```JavaScript

/*
 * GET users listing.
 */

exports.list = function(req, res){
  res.send("respond with a resource");
};
```

These simple routes will just pass along the request to our views, including the user if present.

- Create the `/views/index.ejs` view under the root directory. this is a simple page that will call our policies for sign-in and sign-out and allow us to grab account information. Notice that we can use the conditional `if (!user)` as the user being passed through in the request is evidence we have a logged in user.

```JavaScript
<% if (!user) { %>
	<h2>Welcome! Please log in.</h2>
	<a href="/login/?p=your facebook policy">Sign In with Facebook</a>
	<a href="/login/?p=your email sign-in policy">Sign In With Email</a>
	<a href="/login/?p=your email sign-up policy">Sign Up With Email</a>
<% } else { %>
	<h2>Hello, <%= user.displayName %>.</h2>
	<a href="/account">Account Info</a></br>
	<a href="/logout">Log Out</a>
<% } %>
```

- Create the `/views/account.ejs` view under the root directory so that we can view additional information that `passport-azuread` has put in the user request.

```Javascript
<% if (!user) { %>
	<h2>Welcome! Please log in.</h2>
	<a href="/login">Log In</a>
<% } else { %>
<p>displayName: <%= user.displayName %></p>
<p>givenName: <%= user.name.givenName %></p>
<p>familyName: <%= user.name.familyName %></p>
<p>UPN: <%= user._json.upn %></p>
<p>Profile ID: <%= user.id %></p>
<p>Full Claimes</p>
<%- JSON.stringify(user) %>
<p></p>
<a href="/logout">Log Out</a>
<% } %>
```

Finally, build and run your app!

Run `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`


Sign up or sign into the app with email or Facebook. Sign out, and sign back in as a different user.
