# Azure AD B2C Preview: Build a .NET web app

<!-- TODO [AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher.md)]-->

With Azure AD B2C, you can add powerful self-service identity managment features to your web app in a few short steps.  This article will show you how
to create a .NET MVC web app that includes user sign-up, sign-in, and profile management.  It will include support for sign-up & sign-in with a username
or email, as well as social accounts such as Facebook & Google.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

## 1. Get an Azure AD B2C directory

Before you can use Azure AD B2C, you must create a directory, or tenant.  A directory is a container for all your users, apps, groups, and so on.  If you don't have
one already, go [create a B2C directory](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) before moving on.

## 2. Create an application

Now you need to create an app in your B2C directory, which gives Azure AD some information that it needs to securely communicate with your app.  To create an app,
follow [these instructions](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md).  Be sure to

- Include a **web app/web api** in the application
- Enter `https://localhost:44316/` as a **Reply URL** - it is the default URL for this code sample.
- Copy down the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app.  You will need it shortly.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## 3. Create your policies

In Azure AD B2C, every user experience is defined by a [**policy**](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md).  This code sample contains three 
identity experiences - sign-up, sign-in, and edit profile.  You will need to create one policy of each type, as described in the 
[policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md#how-to-create-a-sign-up-policy).  When creating your three policies, be sure to:

- Choose **User ID signup** or **Email signup** in the identity providers blade.
- Choose the **Display Name** and a few other sign-up attributes in your sign-up policy.
- Choose the **Display Name** claim as an application claim in every policy.  You can choose other claims as well.
- Copy down the **Name** of each policy after you create it.  You'll need those policy names shortly. 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy.md)]

Once you have your three policies successfully created, you're ready to build your app.

## 4. Download the code and configure authentication

The code for this sample is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet).  To build the sample as you go, you can 
[download a skeleton project as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip) or clone the skeleton:

```
git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet.git
```

The completed sample also [available as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip) or on the
`complete` branch of the same repo.

Once you've downloaded the sample code, open the Visual Studio `.sln` file to get started.

Your app communicates with Azure AD B2C by sending HTTP authentication requests, specifying the policy it wishes to execute as part of the request.
For .NET web applications, you can use Microsoft's OWIN library to send OpenID Connect authentication requests, execute policies, manage the user's
session, and so on.

To begin, add the OWIN middleware NuGet packages to the project using the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb
```

Next, open the `web.config` file in the root of the project, and enter your app's configuration values in the `<appSettings>` section.

```
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="[Enter the name of your B2C directory, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com]" /> 
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="[Enter the Application Id assinged to your app by the Azure portal, e.g.580e250c-8f26-49d0-bee8-1c078add1609]" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}{1}{2}" />
    <add key="ida:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44316/" />
    <add key="ida:SignUpPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign up policy name, e.g. b2c_1_sign_up]" />
    <add key="ida:SignInPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign in policy name, e.g. b2c_1_sign_in]" />
    <add key="ida:UserProfilePolicyId" value="[Enter your edit profile policy name, e.g. b2c_1_profile_edit]" />
  </appSettings>
...
```

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]

Now, Add an "OWIN Startup Class" to the project called `Startup.cs`.  Right click on the project --> **Add** --> **New Item** --> Search for "OWIN".  
Change the class declaration to `public partial class Startup` - we've already implemented part of this class for you in another file.  
The OWIN middleware will invoke the `Configuration(...)` method when your app starts - in this method, make a call to ConfigureAuth(...), where we
will set up authentication for your app.

```C#
// Startup.cs

public partial class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        ConfigureAuth(app);
    }
}
```

Open the file `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs` and implement the `ConfigureAuth(...)` method.  The parameters you provide in `OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions` 
will serve as coordinates for your app to communicate with Azure AD.  You'll also need to set up Cookie Authentication - the OpenID Connect middleware 
uses cookies to maintain the user session, amongst other things.

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

public partial class Startup
{
    // The ACR claim is used to indicate which policy was executed
    public const string AcrClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnclassreference";
    public const string PolicyKey = "b2cpolicy";
    public const string OIDCMetadataSuffix = "/.well-known/openid-configuration";

    // App config settings
    private static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
    private static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
    private static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
    private static string redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:RedirectUri"];

    // B2C policy identifiers
    public static string SignUpPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpPolicyId"];
    public static string SignInPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignInPolicyId"];
    public static string ProfilePolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:UserProfilePolicyId"];

    public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

        app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

        OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions options = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
        {
            // These are standard OpenID Connect parameters, with values pulled from web.config
            ClientId = clientId,
            RedirectUri = redirectUri,
            PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
            Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
            { 
                AuthenticationFailed = AuthenticationFailed,
                RedirectToIdentityProvider = OnRedirectToIdentityProvider,
            },
            Scope = "openid",
            ResponseType = "id_token",

            // The PolicyConfigurationManager takes care of getting the correct Azure AD authentication
            // endpoints from the OpenID Connect metadata endpoint.  It is included in the PolicyAuthHelpers folder.
            // The first parameter is the metadata URL of your B2C directory
            // The second parameter is an array of the policies that your app will use.
            ConfigurationManager = new PolicyConfigurationManager(
                String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant, "/v2.0", OIDCMetadataSuffix),
                new string[] { SignUpPolicyId, SignInPolicyId, ProfilePolicyId }),

            // This piece is optional - it is used for displaying the user's name in the navigation bar.
            TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {  
                NameClaimType = "name",
            },
        };

        app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(options);
            
    }
```

## 5. Send authentication requests to Azure AD
Your app is now properly configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C using the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  OWIN has taken care of all of the ugly details
of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session.  All that remains is to initiate each user flow.

When a user clicks the "Sign Up", "Sign In", or "Edit Profile" buttons in the web app, the associated action will be invoked in the `Controllers\AccountController.cs`.
In each case, you can use built-in OWIN methods to trigger the right policy:

```C#
// Controllers\AccountController.cs

public void SignIn()
{
    if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        // To execute a policy, you simply need to trigger an OWIN challenge.
        // You can indicate which policy to use by adding it to the AuthenticationProperties using the PolicyKey provided.
    
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties (
                new Dictionary<string, string> 
                { 
                    {Startup.PolicyKey, Startup.SignInPolicyId}
                })
            { 
                RedirectUri = "/", 
            }, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
    }
}

public void SignUp()
{
    if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties(
                new Dictionary<string, string> 
                { 
                    {Startup.PolicyKey, Startup.SignUpPolicyId}
                })
            {
                RedirectUri = "/",
            }, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
    }
}


public void Profile()
{
    if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties(
                new Dictionary<string, string> 
                { 
                    {Startup.PolicyKey, Startup.ProfilePolicyId}
                })
            {
                RedirectUri = "/",
            }, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
    }
}
```

You can also use a custom `PolicyAuthorize` tag in your controllers to require that a certain policy is executed if the user is not already signed in.
Open `Controllers\HomeController.cs`, and add the `[PolicyAuthorize]` tag to the Claims controller.  Make sure to replace the example policy included
with your own sign in policy.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

// You can use the PolicyAuthorize decorator to execute a certain policy if the user is not already signed into the app.
[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "b2c_1_sign_in")]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
  ...
```

You can use OWIN to sign the user out of the app as well.  Back in `Controllers\AccountController.cs`:  

```C#
// Controllers\AccountController.cs

public void SignOut()
{
    // To sign out the user, you should issue an OpenIDConnect sign out request using the last policy that the user executed.
    // This is as easy as looking up the current value of the ACR claim, adding it to the AuthenticationProperties, and making an OWIN SignOut call.

    HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
        new AuthenticationProperties(
            new Dictionary<string, string> 
            { 
                {Startup.PolicyKey, ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value}
            }), OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
}
```

By default, OWIN will not send the policies you specified in the `AuthenticationProperties` to Azure AD.  However, you can edit the requests that OWIN generates in the `RedirectToIdentityProvider` notification.
Use this notification in `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs` to fetch the right endpoint for each policy from the policy's metadata.  This will ensure that the correct request is sent to Azure AD for each policy that your app wants to execute.   

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

private async Task OnRedirectToIdentityProvider(RedirectToIdentityProviderNotification<OpenIdConnectMessage, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions> notification)
{
    PolicyConfigurationManager mgr = notification.Options.ConfigurationManager as PolicyConfigurationManager;
    if (notification.ProtocolMessage.RequestType == OpenIdConnectRequestType.LogoutRequest)
    {
        OpenIdConnectConfiguration config = await mgr.GetConfigurationByPolicyAsync(CancellationToken.None, notification.OwinContext.Authentication.AuthenticationResponseRevoke.Properties.Dictionary[Startup.PolicyKey]);
        notification.ProtocolMessage.IssuerAddress = config.EndSessionEndpoint;
    }
    else
    {
        OpenIdConnectConfiguration config = await mgr.GetConfigurationByPolicyAsync(CancellationToken.None, notification.OwinContext.Authentication.AuthenticationResponseChallenge.Properties.Dictionary[Startup.PolicyKey]);
        notification.ProtocolMessage.IssuerAddress = config.AuthorizationEndpoint;
    }
}
``` 

## 6. Display user information
When authenticating users with OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an id_token to the app that contains **claims**, or assertions about the user.  You can use these claims to personalize your app.  

Open the `Controllers\HomeController.cs` file.  You can access the user's claims in your controllers via the `ClaimsPrincipal.Current` security principal object.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "b2c_1_sign_in")]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
	Claim displayName = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Identities.First().NameClaimType);
	ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName != null ? displayName.Value : string.Empty;
    return View();
}
```

You can access any claim your application receives in the same way.  A list of all the claims the app recieves has been printed out on the Claims page for your inspection.

## 7. Run the sample app

Finally, build and run your app!   Sign up for the app with an email address or username.  Sign out, and sign back in as the same user.  Edit that user's profile.  Sign out, and sign up
using a different user.  Notice how the information displayed on the **Claims** tab corresponds to the information you configured on your policies.

## 8. Add social IDPs

Currently, the app only supports user sign-up & sign-in with what are called **local accounts** - accounts stored in your B2C directory with a username & password.  With Azure AD B2C,
you can add support for other **identity providers**, or IDPs, without changing any of your code.

To add social IDPs to your app, begin by following the detailed instructions in one or two of these articles.  For each IDP you want to support, you will need to register an application
in their system and obtain a client ID.

- [Set up Facebook as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-fb-app.md)
- [Set up Google as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-goog-app.md)
- [Set up Amazon as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-amzn-app.md)
- [Set up LinkedIn as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-li-app.md) 

When you've added the identity providers to your B2C directory, you'll need to go back and edit each of your three policies to include the new IDPs,
as described in the [policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md).  After you've saved your policies, just run the app again.  You should see
the new IDPs added as a sign-in & sign-up option in each of your identity experiences.

You can experiment with your policies freely, and observe the effect on your sample app - add/remove IDPs, manipulate the application claims, change the sign up attributes.
Experiment until you begin to understand how policies, authentication requests, and OWIN all tie together.
