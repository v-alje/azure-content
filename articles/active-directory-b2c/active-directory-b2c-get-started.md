# Azure Active Directory B2C preview: how to create an Azure AD B2C Tenant

To start using Azure Active Directory (AD) B2C, follow the 3 steps outlined below.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

## Step 1: Sign up for an Azure Subscription

If you already have an Azure subscription move on to the next step. If not, sign up for [an Azure subscription](../active-directory/sign-up-organization.md) and get access to Azure AD B2C.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
Azure AD B2C preview is currently free for use but limited (up to 50,000 users per tenant). An Azure subscription is needed to access the [Azure Classic Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).

## Step 2: Create an Azure AD B2C Tenant

Use the following steps to create a new Azure AD B2C tenant. Currently B2C features can't be turned on in your existing directories, if you have any.

1. Sign into the [Azure Classic Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) as the Subscription Administrator. This is the same work or school account or the same Microsoft Account that you used to sign up for Azure.
2. Click **New** > **App Services** > **Active Directory** > **Directory** > **Custom Create**.

3. Choose the **name**, **domain name** and **country or region** for your tenant.
4. Check the option that says "**This is a B2C directory**".
5. Click the check mark to complete the action.

6. Your tenant is now created and will appear in the Active Directory extension. You are also made a Global Administrator of the tenant. You can add other Global Administrators as required.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
    It can take up to two minutes for your tenant to be created. If you face issues during tenant creation, check out this [article](active-directory-b2c-support-create-directory.md) for guidance.

## Step 3: Navigate to the B2C Features blade on the Azure Portal

1. Navigate to the Active Directory extension on the navigation bar on the left hand side.
2. Find your tenant under the **Directory** tab and click on it.
3. Click on the **Configure** tab.
4. Click on the **Manage B2C settings** link in the **B2C administration** section.

4. The Azure Portal with the B2C features blade will open in a new browser tab or window.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
    There is a known issue where this page doesn't load properly (for a small number of tenants). Refreshing the browser should fix it. If not, please contact Support.

5. Pin this blade (see top right corner) to your Startboard for easy access.

    ![B2C features blade](./media/active-directory-b2c-get-started/b2c-features-blade.png)

    > [AZURE.NOTE]
    You can manage users & groups, self-service password reset configuration and company branding features of your tenant on the [Azure Classic Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

## Next Steps

Move onto [registering an application with Azure AD B2C and building a Quick Start Application](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md).
