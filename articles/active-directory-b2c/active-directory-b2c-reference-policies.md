# Azure Active Directory B2C preview: Extensible Policy Framework

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

## The Basics

Azure Active Directory (AD) B2C's extensible policy framework is the core strength of the service. Policies fully describe consumer identity experiences such as sign up, sign in or profile editing. For instance, a sign-up policy allows you to control behaviors by configuring the following settings:

- Account types (social accounts such as Facebook & Google and / or local accounts such as email address / username & password) that can consumers use to sign up for the application.
- Attributes (for example, first name, postal code, shoe size, etc.) to be collected from the consumer during sign up. 
- Use of multi-factor authentication.
- The look-and-feel of all sign-up pages.
- Information (which manifests as claims in a token) that the application receives when the policy run completes.

You can create multiple policies of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. Policies can be re-used across applications. This allows developers to define & modify consumer identity experiences with minimal or no changes to their code. We will continue to add richer policy types to our service.

Policies are available for use via a simple developer interface. Your application triggers a policy using a standard HTTP authentication request (passing a policy parameter in the request) and receives a customized token as response. For example, the only difference between requests invoking a sign-up policy and a sign-in policy is the policy name used in the "p" query string parameter:

```

https://login.microsoftonline.com/contosob2c.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application ID
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A44321%2F    // Your registered Reply URL, url encoded
&response_mode=form_post                            // 'query', 'form_post' or 'fragment'
&response_type=id_token
&scope=openid
&nonce=dummy
&state=12345                                        // Any value provided by your application
&p=b2c_1_siup                                       // Your sign-up policy

```

```

client_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application ID
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A44321%2F    // Your registered Reply URL, url encoded
&response_mode=form_post                            // 'query', 'form_post' or 'fragment'
&response_type=id_token
&scope=openid
&nonce=dummy
&state=12345                                        // Any value provided by your application
&p=b2c_1_siin                                       // Your sign-in policy

```

## How to create a Sign-up Policy

To enable sign up on your application, you will need to create a Sign-up policy. This policy describes the experiences that consumers will go through during sign up and the contents of tokens that the application will receive on successful sign ups.

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure Portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade).
2. Click **Sign-up policies**.
3. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
4. The **Name** determines the sign-up policy name used by your application. For example, enter "SiUp".
5. Click **Identity providers** and select "Email address". Optionally, you can also select social identity providers, if already configured. Click **OK**.
6. Click **Sign-up attributes**. Here you choose attributes that you want to collect from the consumer during sign up. For example, select "Country/Region", "Display Name" and "Postal Code". Click **OK**.
7. Click **Application claims**. Here you choose claims that you want returned in the tokens sent back to your application after a successful sign up experience. For example, select "Display Name", "Identity Provider", "Postal Code", "User is new" and "User's Object ID".
8. Click **Create**. Note that the policy just created appears as "**B2C_1_SiUp**" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically pre-pending) in the **Sign-up policies** blade.
9. Open the policy by clicking on "**B2C_1_SiUp**".
10. Select "Contoso B2C app" in the **Applications** drop-down and `https://localhost:44321/` in the **Reply URL / Redirect URI** drop-down. Click the **Run now** button. A new browser tab opens up and you can run through the consumer experience of signing up for your application.

    It takes up to a minute for policy creation & updates to take effect.

## How to create a Sign-in Policy

To enable sign in on your application, you will need to create a Sign-in policy. This policy describes the experiences that consumers will go through during sign in and the contents of tokens that the application will receive on successful sign ins.

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure Portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade).
2. Click **Sign-in policies**.
3. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
4. The **Name** determines the sign-in policy name used by your application. For example, enter "SiIn".
5. Click **Identity providers** and select "Email address". Optionally, you can also select social identity providers, if already configured. Click **OK**.
6. Click **Application claims**. Here you choose claims that you want returned in the tokens sent back to your application after a successful sign in experience. For example, select "Display Name", "Identity Provider", "Postal Code"  and "User's Object ID". Click **OK**.
7. Click **Create**. Note that the policy just created appears as "**B2C_1_SiIn**" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically added) in the **Sign-in policies** blade.
8. Open the policy by clicking on "**B2C_1_SiIn**".
9. Select "Contoso B2C app" in the **Applications** drop-down and `https://localhost:44321/` in the **Reply URL / Redirect URI** drop-down. Click the **Run now** button. A new browser tab opens up and you can run through the consumer experience of signing into your application.

## How to create a Profile Editing Policy

To enable profile editing on your application, you will need to create a Profile editing policy. This policy describes the experiences that consumers will go through during profile editing and the contents of tokens that the application will receive on successful completion.

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure Portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade).
2. Click **Profile editing policies**.
3. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
4. The **Name** determines the profile editing policy name used by your application. For example, enter "SiPe".
5. Click **Identity providers** and select "Email address". Optionally, you can also select social identity providers, if already configured. Click **OK**.
6. Click **Profile attributes**. Here you choose attributes that the consumer can view & edit. For example, select "Country/Region", "Display Name" and "Postal Code". Click **OK**.
7. Click **Application claims**. Here you choose claims that you want returned in the tokens sent back to your application after a successful profile editing experience. For example, select "Display Name" and "Postal Code".
8. Click **Create**. Note that the policy just created appears as "**B2C_1_SiPe**" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically pre-pending) in the **Profile editing policies** blade.
9. Open the policy by clicking on "**B2C_1_SiPe**".
10. Select "Contoso B2C app" in the **Applications** drop-down and `https://localhost:44321/` in the **Reply URL / Redirect URI** drop-down. Click the **Run now** button. A new browser tab opens up and you can run through the profile editing consumer experience in your application.
