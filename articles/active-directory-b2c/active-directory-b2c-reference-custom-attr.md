#  Azure Active Directory B2C preview: use Custom Attributes to collect Information about your Consumers

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

Your Azure Active Directory (AD) B2C directory comes with a built-in set of attributes; for example, Given Name, Surname, City, Postal Code, etc. However, every consumer-facing application has unique requirements on what information (attributes) they would like to gather from their consumers. Azure AD B2C allows you to extend your directory (specifically, extend the set of attributes stored on each consumer account). You can create custom attributes on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and use it in your sign-up policies as shown below. You can also read & write these attributes using Azure AD Graph API as shown [here](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-graph-dotnet.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE]
Custom attributes use [Azure AD Graph API Directory Schema Extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn720459.aspx) under the hood.

## How to create a Custom Attribute

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure Portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade).
2. Click **User attributes**.
3. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
4. Provide a **Name** for the custom attribute (for example, "ShoeSize") and optionally, a **Description**. Click **Create**. You're done!

    > [AZURE.NOTE]
    Only the "String" **Data Type** is available currently. We will be adding more data types (DateTime, Integer, etc.) in the future.

The custom attribute is now available in the list of **User attributes** and for use in your sign-up policies.

## How to use a Custom Attribute in your Sign-up Policy

1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure Portal](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade).
2. Click **Sign-up policies**.
3. Open your sign-up policy (for example, "B2C_1_SiUp") by clicking on it. Click **Edit** at the top of the blade.
4. Click **Sign-up attributes** and select the custom attribute (for example, "ShoeSize"). Click **OK**.
5. Click **Application claims** and select the custom attribute. Click **OK**. 
6. Click **Save** at the top of the blade. You're done!

You can use the "Run now" feature on the policy to verify the consumer experience. You should now see "ShoeSize" in the list of attributes being collected during consumer sign-up and see it in the token sent back to your application.
