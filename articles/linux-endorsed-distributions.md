And with more than 9,200 certified applications from over 1,800 independent software vendors for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, SUSE ensures that workloads running supported in the data center can be confidently deployed on Windows Azure.

The following table shows the different distribution versions, LIS drivers and Agent Versions that have been tested to work on Windows Azure.
The table also includes a link to the Kernel compatibility patch required by some distribution versions to work optimally in Windows Azure.

Note that the different distributions will be incorporating the agent to their official distribution archives shortly, but for the time being we are releasing all the RPM and Deb packages for the agent plus the drivers for CentOS on the same ISO.
