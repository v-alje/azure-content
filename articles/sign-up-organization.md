<h1 id="signup">Sign up for Windows Azure as an organization</h1>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [disclaimer](../includes/disclaimer.md)]

Until recently, you could only sign up for a new Windows Azure subscription using your Microsoft account (Windows Live ID). Windows Azure now supports using either of the following two account methods to sign up:

* **Microsoft accounts** (created by you for personal use) - Provide access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, SkyDrive, MSN, Xbox LIVE, or Office Live. Signing up for Outlook automatically creates a Microsoft account with an @Outlook.com address. Once created, a Microsoft account can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services and/or Windows Azure.

* **Organizational accounts** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provide access to all small, middle and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Windows Azure, Windows Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to either one of these services as an organization, a cloud based tenant is automatically provisioned in Windows Azure Active Directory to represent your organization.

	Once this tenant has been created, an admin can then issue organizational accounts to each of its employees/students and assign licenses to those accounts based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Windows Azure.
