# Deploy Azure Resources Using the Compute, Network, and Storage .NET Libraries

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model.

This tutorial shows you how to use the Compute, Storage, and Network .NET libraries to create and delete resources in Microsoft Azure. It also shows you how to authenticate the requests to Azure Resource Manager by using Azure Active Directory.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [free-trial-note](../../includes/free-trial-note.md)]

To complete this tutorial you also need:

- [Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd831853.aspx)
- [Azure storage account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md)
- [Windows Management Framework 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=34595) or [Windows Management Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855)

[AZURE.INCLUDE [powershell-preview](../../includes/powershell-preview-inline-include.md)]

It takes about 30 minutes to do these steps.

## Step 1: Add an application to Azure AD and set permissions

To use Azure AD to authenticate requests to Azure Resource Manager, an application must be added to the Default Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager](../resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md)

1. Open an Azure PowerShell prompt, run this command, and then enter the credentials for your subscription when prompted:

			Login-AzureRmAccount

2. Replace {password} in the following command with the one that you want to use and then run it to create the application:

			New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "My AD Application 1" -HomePage "https://myapp1.com" -IdentifierUris "https://myapp1.com"  -Password "{password}"

	>[AZURE.NOTE] Take note of the application identifer that is returned after the application is created because you'll need it for the next step. You can also find the application identifier in the client id field of the application in the Active Directory section of the Azure portal.

3. Replace {application-id} with the identifier that you just recorded and then create the service principal for the application:

        New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId {application-id}

4. Set the permission to use the application:

	    New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Owner -ServicePrincipalName "https://myapp1.com"

## Step 2: Create a Visual Studio project and install the libraries

NuGet packages are the easiest way to install the libraries that you need to finish this tutorial. You must install the Azure Resource Management Library, the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library, and the Computer Resource Provider Library. To get these libraries in Visual Studio, do the following:

1. Click **File** > **New** > **Project**.

2. In **Templates** > **Visual C#**, select **Console Application**, enter the name and location of the project, and then click **OK**.

3. Right-click the project name in the Solution Explorer, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.

4. Type *Active Directory* in the search box, click **Install** for the Active Directory Authentication Library package, and then follow the instructions to install the package.

5. At the top of the page, select **Include Prerelease**. Type *Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute* in the search box, click **Install** for the Compute .NET Libraries, and then follow the instructions to install the package.

6. Type *Microsoft.Azure.Management.Network* in the search box, click **Install** for the Network .NET Libraries, and then follow the instructions to install the package.

7. Type *Microsoft.Azure.Management.Storage* in the search box, click **Install** for the Storage .NET Libraries, and then follow the instructions to install the package.

8. Type *Microsoft.Azure.Management.Resources* in the search box, click **Install** for the Resource Management Libraries.

You are now ready to start using the libraries to create your application.

## Step 3: Create the credentials that are used to authenticate requests

Now that the Azure Active Directory application is created and the authentication library is installed, you format the application information into credentials that are used to authenticate requests to Azure Resource Manager.

1. Open the Program.cs file for the project that you created, and then add the following using statements to the top of the file:

	```
	using Microsoft.Azure;
	using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Resources;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Resources.Models;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Storage;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Storage.Models;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Network;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Network.Models;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models;
	using Microsoft.Rest;
	```

2. Add this method to the Program class to get the token that is needed to create the credentials:

	```
	private static string GetAuthorizationHeader()
	{
		ClientCredential cc = new ClientCredential("{application-id}", "{password}");
		var context = new AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/{tenant-id}");
		var result = context.AcquireTokenAsync("https://management.azure.com/", cc);

		if (result == null)
		{
			throw new InvalidOperationException("Failed to obtain the JWT token");
		}

		string token = result.AccessToken;

		return token;
	}
	```

	Replace {application-id} with the application identifier that you recorded earlier, {password} with the password that you chose for the AD application, and {tenant-id} with the tenant identifier for your subscription. You can find the tenant id by running Get-AzureSubscription.

3. Add this code to the Main method in the Program.cs file to create the credentials:

	```
	var token = GetAuthorizationHeader();
	var credential = new TokenCredentials(token);
	```

5. Save the Program.cs file.

## Step 4: Add the code to register the providers and create the resources

### Register the providers and create a resource group

All resources must be contained in a resource group. Before you can add resources to a group, your subscription must be registered with the resource providers.

1. Add variables to the Main method of the Program class to specify the names that you want to use for the resources, the location of the resources, such as "West US", administrator account information, and your subscription identifier:

	```
	var groupName = "{resource-group-name}";
	var ipName = "{public-ip-name}";
	var avSetName = "{availability-set-name}";
	var nicName = "{network-interface-name}";
	var storageName = "{storage-account-name}";
	var vmName = "{virtual-machine-name};  
	var vnetName = "{vnet-name}";
	var subnetName = "{subnet-name}";
	var adminName = "{administrator-account-name}";
	var adminPassword = "{administrator-account-password};
	var location = "{location}";
	var subscriptionId = "{subsciption-id}";
	```

   Replace all of the bracketed placeholders with the names that you want to use. You can find the subscription identifier by running Get-AzureSubscription.

2. Add this method to the Program class to create the resource group:

	```
	public static void CreateResourceGroup(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Creating the resource group...");
		var resourceManagementClient = new ResourceManagementClient(credential);
		resourceManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var resourceGroup = new ResourceGroup {
			Location = location
		};
		var rgResult = resourceManagementClient.ResourceGroups.CreateOrUpdate(groupName, resourceGroup);
		Console.WriteLine(rgResult.Properties.ProvisioningState);

		var rpResult = resourceManagementClient.Providers.Register("Microsoft.Storage");
		Console.WriteLine(rpResult.RegistrationState);
		rpResult = resourceManagementClient.Providers.Register("Microsoft.Network");
		Console.WriteLine(rpResult.RegistrationState);
		rpResult = resourceManagementClient.Providers.Register("Microsoft.Compute");
		Console.WriteLine(rpResult.RegistrationState);
	}
	```

3. Add this code to the Main method to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreateResourceGroup(
		credential,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

### Create a storage account

A storage account is needed to store the virtual hard disk file that is created for the virtual machine.

1. Add this method to the Program class to create the storage account:

	```
	public static void CreateStorageAccount(
		TokenCredentials credential,         
		string storageName,
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Creating the storage account...");
		var storageManagementClient = new StorageManagementClient(credential);
		storageManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var saResult = storageManagementClient.StorageAccounts.Create(
			groupName,
			storageName,
			new StorageAccountCreateParameters()
			{
				AccountType = AccountType.StandardLRS,
				Location = location
			}
		);
		Console.WriteLine(saResult.ProvisioningState);
	}
	```

2. Add this code to the Main method of the Program class to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreateStorageAccount(
		credential,
		storageName,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

### Create the public IP address

A public IP address is needed to communicate with the virtual machine.

1. Add this method to the Program class to create the public IP address:

	```
	public static void CreatePublicIPAddress(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string ipName,  
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Creating the public ip...");
		var networkManagementClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credential);
		networkManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var ipResult = networkManagementClient.PublicIPAddresses.CreateOrUpdate(
			groupName,
			ipName,
			new PublicIPAddress
			{
				Location = location,
				PublicIPAllocationMethod = "Dynamic"
			}
		);
		Console.WriteLine(ipResult.ProvisioningState);
	}
	```

2. Add this code to the Main method of the Program class to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreatePublicIPAddress(
		credential,
		ipName,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

### Create the virtual network

A virtual machine that's created with the Resource Manager deployment model must be in a virtual network.

1. Add this method to the Program class to create a subnet and a virtual network:

	```
	public static void CreateNetwork(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string vnetName,
		string subnetName,
		string nicName,
		string ipName,
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Creating the virtual network...");
		var networkManagementClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credential);
		networkManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;

		var subnet = new Subnet
		{
			Name = subnetName,
			AddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/24"
		};

		var address = new AddressSpace {
			AddressPrefixes = new List<string> { "10.0.0.0/16" }
		};

		var vnResult = networkManagementClient.VirtualNetworks.CreateOrUpdate(
			groupName,
			vnetName,
			new VirtualNetwork
			{
				Location = location,
				AddressSpace = address,
				Subnets = new List<Subnet> { subnet }
			}
		);
		Console.WriteLine(vnResult.ProvisioningState);

		var subnetResponse = networkManagementClient.Subnets.Get(
			groupName,
			vnetName,
			subnetName
		);

		var pubipResponse = networkManagementClient.PublicIPAddresses.Get(groupName, ipName);

		Console.WriteLine("Updating the network with the nic...");
		var nicResult = networkManagementClient.NetworkInterfaces.CreateOrUpdate(
			groupName,
			nicName,
			new NetworkInterface
			{
				Location = location,
				IpConfigurations = new List<NetworkInterfaceIPConfiguration>
				{
					new NetworkInterfaceIPConfiguration
					{
						Name = "nicConfig1",
						PublicIPAddress = pubipResponse,
						Subnet = subnetResponse
					}
				}
			}
		);
		Console.WriteLine(vnResult.ProvisioningState);
	}
	```

2. Add this code to the Main method of the Program class to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreateNetwork(
		credential,
		vnetName,
		subnetName,
		nicName,
		ipName,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

### Create an availability set

Availability sets make it easier for you to manage the maintenance of the virtual machines used by your application.

1. Add this method to the Program class to create the availability set:

	```
	public static void CreateAvailabilitySet(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string avsetName,
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Creating the availability set...");
		var computeManagementClient = new ComputeManagementClient(credential);
		computeManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var avResult = computeManagementClient.AvailabilitySets.CreateOrUpdate(
			groupName,
			avsetName,
			new AvailabilitySet()
			{
				Location = location
			}
		);
	}
	```

2. Add this code the the Main method of the Program class to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreateAvailabilitySet(
		credential,
		avsetName,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

### Create a virtual machine

Now that you created all of the supporting resources, you can create a virtual machine.

1. Add this method to the Program class to create the virtual machine:

	```
	public static void CreateVirtualMachine(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string vmName,
		string groupName,
		string nicName,
		string avsetName,
		string storageName,
		string adminName,
		string adminPassword,
		string subscriptionId,
		string location)
	{
		var networkManagementClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credential);
		networkManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var nic = networkManagementClient.NetworkInterfaces.Get(groupName, nicName);

		var computeManagementClient = new ComputeManagementClient(credential);
		computeManagementClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
		var avSet = computeManagementClient.AvailabilitySets.Get(groupName, avsetName);

		Console.WriteLine("Creating the virtual machine...");
		var vm = computeManagementClient.VirtualMachines.CreateOrUpdate(
			groupName,
			vmName,
			new VirtualMachine
			{
				Location = location,
				AvailabilitySet = new Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models.SubResource
				{
					Id = avSet.Id
				},
				HardwareProfile = new HardwareProfile
				{
					VmSize = "Standard_A0"
				},
				OsProfile = new OSProfile
				{
					AdminUsername = adminName,
					AdminPassword = adminPassword,
					ComputerName = vmName,
					WindowsConfiguration = new WindowsConfiguration
					{
						ProvisionVMAgent = true
					}
				},
				NetworkProfile = new NetworkProfile
				{
					NetworkInterfaces = new List<NetworkInterfaceReference>
					{
						new NetworkInterfaceReference { Id = nic.Id }
					}
				},
				StorageProfile = new StorageProfile
				{
					ImageReference = new ImageReference
					{
						Publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
						Offer = "WindowsServer",
						Sku = "2012-R2-Datacenter",
						Version = "latest"
					},
					OsDisk = new OSDisk
					{
						Name = "mytestod1",
						CreateOption = "FromImage",
						Vhd = new VirtualHardDisk
						{
							Uri = "http://" + storageName + ".blob.core.windows.net/vhds/mytestod1.vhd"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		);
		Console.WriteLine(vm.ProvisioningState);
	}
	```

	>[AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial creates a virtual machine running a version of the Windows Server operating system. To learn more about selecting other images, see [Navigate and select Azure virtual machine images with Windows PowerShell and the Azure CLI](resource-groups-vm-searching.md).

2. Add the following code to the Main method to call the method that you just added:

	```
	CreateVirtualMachine(
		credential,
		vmName,
		groupName,
		nicName,
		avsetName,
		storageName,
		adminName,
		adminPassword,
		subscriptionId,
		location);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

##Step 5: Add the code to delete the resources

Because you are charged for resources used in Azure, it is always a good practice to delete resources that are no longer needed. If you want to delete the virtual machines and all of the supporting resources, all you have to do is delete the resource group.

1. Add the following method to the Program class to delete the resource group:

	```
	public static void DeleteResourceGroup(
		TokenCredentials credential,
		string groupName,
		string subscriptionId)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Deleting resource group...");
		var resourceGroupClient = new ResourceManagementClient(credential);
		resourceGroupClient.ResourceGroups.DeleteAsync(groupName);
	}
	```

2. Add the following code to the Main method to call the method that you just added:

	```
	DeleteResourceGroup(
		credential,
		groupName,
		subscriptionId);
	Console.ReadLine();
	```

## Step 6: Run the console application

1. To run the console application, click **Start** in Visual Studio, and then sign in to Azure AD using the same username and password that you use with your subscription.

2. Press **Enter** after each status code is returned to create each resource. After the virtual machine is created, do the next step before pressing Enter to delete all of the resources.

	It should take about 5 minutes for this console application to run completely from start to finish. Before you press Enter to start deleting resources, you could take a few minutes to verify the creation of the resources in the Azure portal before you delete them.

3. Browse to the Audit Logs in the Azure portal to see the status of the resources:
