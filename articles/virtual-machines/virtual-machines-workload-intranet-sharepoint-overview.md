# Deploying SharePoint with SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups in Azure

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model.

This topic contains links to the step-by-step instructions for deploying an intranet-only SharePoint 2013 farm with SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups. The farm contains these computers:

- Two SharePoint web servers
- Two SharePoint application servers
- Two database servers
- One cluster majority node server
- Two domain controllers

This is the configuration, with placeholder names for each server.

Two machines for each role ensure high availability. All of the virtual machines are in a single region. Each group of virtual machines for a specific role is in its own availability set.

## Bill of materials

This baseline configuration requires the following set of Azure services and components:

- Nine virtual machines.
- Four extra data disks for the domain controllers and SQL servers.
- Four availability sets.
- One cross-premises virtual network.
- One storage account.
- One Azure subscription.

Here are the virtual machines and thier default sizes for this configuration.

Item | Virtual machine description | Gallery image | Default size
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. | First domain controller | Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter | A2
2. | Second domain controller | Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter | A2
3. | First database server | Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Enterprise – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A5
4. | Second database server | Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Enterprise – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A5
5. | Majority node for the cluster | Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter | A1
6. | First SharePoint application server | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 Trial – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A4
7. | Second SharePoint application server | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 Trial – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A4
8. | First SharePoint web server | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 Trial – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A4
9. | Second SharePoint web server | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 Trial – Windows Server 2012 R2 | A4

To compute the estimated costs for this configuration, see the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/). 

1. In **Modules**, click **Compute**, and then click **Virtual Machines** enough times to create a list of nine virtual machines.
2. For each virtual machine, select:
	- Your intended region
	- **Windows** for the type
	- **Standard** for the pricing tier
	- The default size in the previous table or your intended size for the **Instance size**

> [AZURE.NOTE] The Azure Pricing Calculator does not include the additional costs for the SQL Server license for the two virtual machines running SQL Server 2014 Enterprise. See [Virtual Machines Pricing-SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/#Sql) for more information.

## Phases of deployment

You deploy this configuration in the following phases:

- [Phase 1: Configure Azure](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase1.md). Create a storage account, availability sets, and a cross-premises virtual network.
- [Phase 2: Configure domain controllers](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase2.md). Create and configure replica Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers.
- [Phase 3: Configure SQL Server infrastructure](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase3.md). Create and configure the SQL Server virtual machines, prepare them for use with SharePoint, and create the cluster.
- [Phase 4: Configure SharePoint servers](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase4.md). Create and configure the four SharePoint virtual machines.
- [Phase 5: Create the availability group and add the SharePoint databases](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase5.md). Prepare databases and create a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group.

This deployment of SharePoint with SQL Server AlwaysOn is designed to accompany the [SharePoint with SQL Server AlwaysOn infographic](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394788) and incorporate the latest recommendations.

This configuration is a prescriptive, phase-by-phase guide for a predefined architecture to create a functional, highly available intranet SharePoint farm in Azure infrastructure services. For additional architectural guidance on implementing SharePoint 2013 in Azure, see [Microsoft Azure architectures for SharePoint 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn635309.aspx).

Keep the following in mind:

- If you are an experienced SharePoint implementer, please feel free to adapt the instructions in phases 3 through 5 and build the farm that best suits your needs.
- If you already have an existing Azure hybrid cloud deployment, feel free to adapt or skip the instructions in phases 1 and 2 to host the new SharePoint farm on the appropriate subnet.
- All of the servers are located on a single subnet in the Azure virtual network. If you want to provide additional security equivalent to subnet isolation, you can use [network security groups](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md).

To build a dev/test environment or a proof-of-concept of this configuration, see [Set up a SharePoint intranet farm in a hybrid cloud for testing](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-setup-sharepoint-hybrid-cloud-testing.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE] Microsoft has released the SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview. To make this preview easy to install and test, you can use an Azure virtual machine gallery image with SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview and its prerequisites pre-installed. For more information, see [Test the SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/test-sharepoint-server-2016-it-preview-4/).

## Next step

- Start the configuration of this workload with [Phase 1](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase1.md).
