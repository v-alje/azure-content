# Create SharePoint server farms

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic model.

With the Microsoft Azure portal marketplace, you can quickly create pre-configured SharePoint Server 2013 farms. This can save you a lot of time when you need a basic or high-availability SharePoint farm for a development and testing environment or if you are evaluating SharePoint Server 2013 as a collaboration solution for your organization.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The **SharePoint Server Farm** item in the Azure Marketplace of the Azure portal has been removed. It has been replaced with the **SharePoint 2013 non-HA Farm** and **SharePoint 2013 HA Farm** items.

The basic SharePoint farm consists of three virtual machines in this configuration.

You can use this farm configuration for a simplified setup for SharePoint app development or your first-time evaluation of SharePoint 2013.

To create the basic (three-server) SharePoint farm:

1. Click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/sharepoint2013/sharepoint2013farmsharepoint2013-nonha/).
2. Click **Deploy**.
3. On the **SharePoint 2013 non-HA Farm** pane, click **Create**.
4. Specify settings on the 7 steps of the **Create SharePoint 2013 non-HA Farm** pane, and then click **Create**.

The high-availability SharePoint farm consists of nine virtual machines in this configuration.

You can use this farm configuration to test higher client loads, high availability of the external SharePoint site, and SQL Server AlwaysOn for a SharePoint farm. You can also use this configuration for SharePoint app development in a high-availability environment.

To create the high-availability (nine-server) SharePoint farm:

1. Click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/sharepoint2013/sharepoint2013farmsharepoint2013-ha/).
2. Click **Deploy**.
3. On the **SharePoint 2013 HA Farm** pane, click **Create**.
4. Specify settings on the 7 steps of the **Create SharePoint 2013 HA Farm** pane, and then click **Create**.

## Managing the SharePoint farms

You can administer the servers of these farms through Remote Desktop connections. For more information, see [Log on to the virtual machine](virtual-machines-windows-tutorial.md#log-on-to-the-virtual-machine).

From the Central Administration SharePoint site, you can configure My sites, SharePoint applications, and other functionality. For more information, see [Configure SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee836142.aspx).

> [AZURE.NOTE] The Azure portal creates both of these farms in a cloud-only virtual network with an Internet-facing web presence. There is no site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connection back to your organization network.
