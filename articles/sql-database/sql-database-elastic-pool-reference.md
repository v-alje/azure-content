# SQL Database elastic database pool reference

This reference provides links and details to elastic database pool articles and programmability information. For SaaS developers who have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of databases, an elastic database pool simplifies the process of creating, maintaining, and managing both performance and cost across the entire group of databases.

An elastic database pool is a collection of elastic database throughput units (eDTUs), and storage (GBs) that are shared by multiple databases. Elastic databases can be added to, and removed from the pool at any time. Elastic databases in the pool utilize only the resources they require from the pool freeing up available resources for only the active databases that need them. For assistance in determining if your databases would benefit in an elastic database pool, see [Price and performance considerations for an elastic database pool](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md).



## Prerequisites for creating and managing elastic database pools


- Elastic database pools are only available in Azure SQL Database V12 servers. To upgrade to V12 and migrate your databases directly into a pool, see [Upgrade to Azure SQL Database V12](sql-database-upgrade-server-powershell.md).
- Creating and managing elastic database pools is supported using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [PowerShell](sql-database-elastic-pool-powershell.md), and a .NET Client Library (Azure Resource Manager only); the [classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) and service management commands are not supported.
- Additionally, creating new elastic databases, and moving existing databases in and out of elastic database pools is supported using [Transact-SQL](#transact-sql).

## Namespace and endpoint details
An elastic database pool is an Azure Resource Manager resource of type “ElasticPool” in the Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

- **namespace**: Microsoft.Sql/ElasticPool
- **management-endpoint** for REST API calls (Resource Manager): https://management.azure.com



## Elastic database pool properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| creationDate | Date the pool is created. |
| databaseDtuMax | Maximum number of eDTUs that a single database in the pool may use.  The database eDTU max is not a resource guarantee. The eDTU max applies to all databases in the pool. |
| databaseDtuMin | Minimum number of eDTUs that a single database in the pool is guaranteed. The database eDTU min may be set to 0. The eDTU min applies to all databases in the pool. Note that the product of the number of databases in the pool and the database eDTU min cannot exceed the eDTUs of the pool itself. |
| Dtu | Number of eDTUs shared by all databases in the pool. |
| edition | Service tier of the pool.  Every database within the pool has this edition. |
| elasticPoolId | GUID of the instance of the pool. |
| elasticPoolName | Name of the pool.  The name is unique relative to its parent server. |
| location | Data center location where the pool was created. |
| state | State is “Disabled” if payment of the bill for subscription is delinquent, and “Ready” otherwise. |
| storageMB | Storage limit in MB for the pool. The total of storage used by all databases in the pool cannot exceed this pool limit.  |


## eDTU and storage limits for elastic pools and elastic databases


[AZURE.INCLUDE [SQL DB service tiers table for elastic databases](../../includes/sql-database-service-tiers-table-elastic-db-pools.md)]



## Azure Resource Manager limitations

Azure SQL Database V12 servers are located in resource groups.

- Each resource group can have a maximum 800 servers.
- Each server can have a maximum 800 elastic pools.


## Latency of elastic pool operations

- Changing the guaranteed eDTUs per database (databaseDtuMin) or maximum eDTUs per database (databaseDtuMax) typically completes in 5 minutes or less.
- Changing the eDTU / storage limit (storageMB) of the pool depends on the total amount of space used by all databases in the pool. Changes average 90 minutes or less per 100 GB. For example, if the total space used by all databases in the pool is 200 GB, then the expected latency for changing the pool eDTU / storage limit is 3 hours or less.



## PowerShell, REST API, and the .NET Client Library

Several PowerShell cmdlets and REST API commands are available for creating and managing elastic pools. For details and code examples, see [Create and manage a SQL Database elastic database pool using PowerShell](sql-database-elastic-pool-powershell.md), and [Create and manage SQL Database with C#](sql-database-client-library.md).

## Transact-SQL

You can use Transact-SQL to do the following elastic database management tasks:

| Task | Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| Create a new elastic database (directly in a pool) | [CREATE DATABASE (Azure SQL Database)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn268335.aspx) |
| Move existing databases in and out of a pool | [ALTER DATABASE (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174269.aspx) |
| Get a pool's resource usage statistics | [sys.elastic_pool_resource_stats (Azure SQL Database)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt280062.aspx) |


## Billing and pricing information

Elastic database pools are billed per the following characteristics:

- An elastic pool is billed upon its creation, even when there are no databases in the pool.
- An elastic pool is billed hourly. This is the same metering frequency as for performance levels of single databases.
- If an elastic pool is resized to a new amount of eDTUs, then the pool is not billed according to the new amount of eDTUS until the resizing operation completes. This follows the same pattern as changing the performance level of standalone databases.


- The price of an elastic pool is based on the number of eDTUs of the pool. The price of an elastic pool is independent of the utilization of the elastic databases within it.
- Price is computed by (number of pool eDTUs)x(unit price per eDTU).

The unit eDTU price for an elastic pool is higher than the unit DTU price for a standalone database in the same service tier. For details, see [SQL Database pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/).
