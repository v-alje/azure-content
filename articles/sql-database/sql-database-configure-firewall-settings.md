# How to: Configure firewall settings on SQL Database using the Azure Portal


> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Azure Portal](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md)

SQL Database uses firewall rules to allow connections to your servers and databases. You can define server-level and database-level firewall settings for the master or a user database in your SQL Database logical server to selectively allow access to the database.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To allow applications from Azure to connect to your database server, Azure connections must be enabled. For more information about firewall rules and enabling connections from Azure, see [Azure SQL Database Firewall](sql-database-firewall-configure.md). You may have to open some additional TCP ports if you are making connections inside the Azure cloud boundary. For more information, see the **V12 of SQL Database: Outside vs inside** section of [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5 and SQL Database V12](sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md)


### Manage server-level firewall rules through the Azure portal


[AZURE.INCLUDE [sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal](../../includes/sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal.md)]


## Manage server-level firewall rules 

1. In the Azure portal, click **SQL Databases**. All databases and their corresponding servers are listed here.
2. Click **Servers** at the top of the page.
3. Click the arrow beside the server for which you want to manage firewall rules.
4. Click **Configure** at the top of the page.

	*  To add the current computer, click Add to the Allowed IP Addresses.
	*  To add additional IP addresses, type in the Rule Name, Start IP Address, and End IP Address.
	*  To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule and modify.
	*  To delete an existing rule, hover over the rule until the X appears at the end of the row. Click X to remove the rule.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page to save the changes.
