# Migrate SQL Server database to SQL Database using transactional replication

When you cannot afford to remove your SQL Server database from production while the migration is occurring, you can use SQL Server transactional replication as your migration solution. With transactional replication, all changes to your data or schema that happen between the moment you start migrating and the moment you complete the migration will show up in your Azure SQL Database. Once the migration is complete, you just need to change the connection string of your applications to point them to your Azure SQL Database instead of pointing them to your on premise database. Once transactional replication drains any changes left on your on-premises database and all your applications point to Azure DB, you can now safely uninstall replication leaving your Azure SQL Database as the production system.

Transactional replication is a technology built-in and integrated with SQL Server since SQL Server 6.5. It is a very mature and proven technology that most of DBAs know with which they have experience. With the [SQL Server 2016 preview](http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-2016/), it is now possible to configure your Azure SQL Database as a [transactional replication subscriber](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt589530.aspx) to your on-premises publication. The experience that you get setting it up from Management Studio is exactly the same as if you set up a transactional replication subscriber on an on-premises server. Support for this scenario is supported when the publisher and the distributor is at least one of the following SQL Server versions:

 - SQL Server 2016 CTP3 (preview) and above 
 - SQL Server 2014 SP1 CU3 and above
 - SQL Server 2014 RTM CU10 and above
 - SQL Server 2012 SP2 CU8 and above
 - SQL Server 2013 SP3 when it will release

You can also use transactional replication to migrate a subset of your on-premises database. The publication that you replicate to Azure SQL Database can be limited to a subset of the tables in the database being replicated. Additionally, for each table being replicated, you can limit the data to a subset of the rows and/or a subset of the columns.
