# SQL Database Index Advisor

The Azure SQL Database Index Advisor provides index recommendations for your existing SQL databases that can improve current query performance. The SQL Database service assesses index performance by analyzing your SQL database's usage history. The indexes that are best suited for running your databaseâ€™s typical workload are recommended.

Index advisor assists you in tuning your database performance by:

- providing recommendations on which indexes to create (recommendations are available for non-clustered indexes only).
- providing recommendations on which indexes to drop (drop index recommendations are in preview and currently apply to duplicate indexes only).
- allowing you to opt-in to apply index recommendations automatically without any user interaction. (Automated recommendations require [Query Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn817826.aspx) is enabled and running.)
- automatically rolling back recommendations that have a negative impact on performance. 


This article describes Index Advisor for V12 servers. Index recommendations are available for V11 servers but you must run the provided Transact-SQL (T-SQL) script to implement the recommendation. The advisor will not revert index operations on V11 servers so you should monitor and revert the performance impact as necessary.


### Permissions

To view and create index recommendations, you need the correct [role-based access control](role-based-access-control-configure.md) permissions in Azure. 

- **Reader**, **SQL DB Contributor** permissions are required to view recommendations.
- **Owner**, **SQL DB Contributor** permissions are required to execute any actions; create or drop indexes and cancel index creation.


## Viewing index recommendations

The Index recommendations page is where you view the top suggested indexes based on their potential impact to improve performance. You can also view the status of the last several index operations. Select a recommendation or status to see it's details.

To view index recommendations:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **BROWSE** > **SQL databases**, and select your database.
5. Click **All settings** > **Index Advisor** to view available **Index recommendations** for the selected database.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To get index recommendations a database needs to have about a week of usage, and within that week there needs to be some activity. There also needs to be some consistent activity as well. The index advisor can more easily optimize for consistent query patterns than it can for random spotty bursts of activity. If recommendations are not available the **Index recommendations** page should provide a message explaining why.

![Recommended Indexes](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/recommendations.png)

Recommendations are sorted by their potential impact on performance into the following 4 categories:

| Impact | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| High | High impact recommendations should provide the most significant performance impact. |
| Substantial | Substantial impact recommendations should improve performance noticeably. |
| Moderate | Moderate impact recommendations should improve performance, but not substantially. |
| Low | Low impact recommendations should provide better performance than without the index, but improvements might not be significant. 
Use the Impact tag to determine the best candidates for creating new indexes.


### Removing index recommendations from the list

If your list of recommended indexes contains indexes that you want to remove from the list you can discard the recommendation:

1. Select a recommendation in the list of **Recommended indexes**.
2. Click **Discard index** on the **Index details** blade.


If desired, you can add discarded indexes back to the **Recommended indexes** list:

1. On the **Index recommendations** blade click **View discarded index recommendations**.
1. Select a discarded index from the list to view its details.
1. Optionally, click **Undo Discard** to add the index back to the main list of **Index recommendations**.



## Applying index recommendations

Index Advisor gives you full control over how index recommendations are enabled using any of the 3 options below. 

- Apply individual recommendations one at a time.
- Enable Index Advisor to automatically apply index recommendations.
- Manually run the recommended T-SQL script against your database to implement a recommendation.

Select any recommendation to view it's details and then click **View script** to review the exact details of how the recommendation will be created.

The database remains online while the advisor applies the recommendation -- using Index Advisor will never take a database offline.

### Apply an individual recommendation

You can review and accept recommendations one at a time.

1. On the **Index recommendations** blade click a recommendation.
2. On the **Index details** blade click **Apply**.

    ![Apply recommendation](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/apply.png)


### Enable automatic index management

You can set the Index Advisor to implement recommendations automatically. As recommendations become available they will automatically be applied. As with all index operations managed by the service if the performance impact is negative the recommendation will be reverted.

1. On the **Index recommendations** blade click **Advisor settings**:

    ![Advisor settings](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/settings.png)

2. Set the advisor to automatically **Create** or **Drop** indexes:

    ![Recommended Indexes](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/automation.png)




### Manually run the recommended T-SQL script

Select any recommendation and then click **View script**. Run this script against your database to manually apply the recommendation.

*Indexes that are manually executed are not monitored and validated for performance impact by the service* so it is suggested that you monitor these indexes after creation to verify they provide performance gains and adjust or delete them if necessary. For details about creating indexes, see [CREATE INDEX (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms188783.aspx).


### Canceling index creation

Indexes that are in a **Pending** status can be canceled. Indexes that are being created (**Executing** status) cannot be canceled.

1. Select any **Pending** index in the **Index operations** area to open the **Index details** blade.
2. Click **Cancel** to abort the index creation process.



## Monitoring index operations

Applying a recommendation might not happen instantaneously. The portal provides details regarding the status of index operations. When managing indexes the following are possible states that an index can be in:

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pending | Create index command has been received and the index is scheduled for creation. |
| Executing | The create index command is running and the index is currently being created. |
| Success | The index has successfully been created. |
| Failed | Index has not been created. This can be a transient issue, or possibly a schema change to the table and the script is no longer valid. |
| Reverting | The index creation process has been canceled or has been deemed non-performant and is being automatically reverted. |

Click an in-process recommendation from the list to see it's details:

### Reverting an index

If you used the advisor to create an index (meaning you did not manually run the T-SQL script) it will automatically revert the index if it finds the performance impact to be negative. If for any reason you simply want to revert an index advisor operation you can do the following.


1. Select a successfully created index in the list of **Index operations**.
2. Click **Revert** on the **Index details** blade, or click **View Script** for a DROP INDEX script that you can run.

## Monitoring performance impact of index recommendations

After recommendations are successfully implemented you can click **Query Insights** on the Index details blade to open [Query Performance Insights](sql-database-query-performance.md) and see the performance impact of your top queries.

## Summary

Index Advisor provides index recommendations and an automated experience for managing indexes for SQL database. By providing T-SQL scripts, as well as individual and fully-automatic index management options, the Index Advisor provides helpful assistance in optimizing your databases indexes and ultimately improving query performance.



## Next steps

Monitor your index recommendations and continue to apply them to refine performance. Database workloads are dynamic and change continuously. Index advisor will continue to monitor and recommend indexes that can potentially improve your database's performance.
