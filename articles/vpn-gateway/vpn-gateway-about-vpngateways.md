# About VPN gateways

VPN Gateways are used to send network traffic between virtual networks and on-premises locations. They are also used to send traffic between multiple virtual networks within Azure. When creating a gateway, there are some factors to take into consideration.
 
Consider the following items when planning:

- The gateway SKU that you want to use
- The gateway routing type for your connection
- The VPN device, if required for your connection

## Gateway SKUs

There are 3 VPN Gateway SKUs:

- Basic
- Standard
- High Performance

The table below shows the gateway types and the estimated aggregate throughput. 
Pricing does differ between gateway SKUs. For information about pricing, see [VPN Gateway Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/).

| SKU         | VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute coexist | ExpressRoute Gateway throughput | VPN Gateway throughput | VPN Gateway max IPsec tunnels |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Basic       | No                                | 500 Mbps                        | 100 Mbps               | 10                            |
| Standard    | Yes                               | 1000 Mbps                       | 100 Mbps               | 10                            |
| High Performance | Yes                               | 2000 Mbps                       | 200 Mbps               | 30                            |

**Note:** The VPN throughput is a rough estimate based on the measurements between VNets in the same Azure region. It is not a guarantee of what you can get for cross-premises connections across the Internet, but should be used as a maximum possible measure.

## Gateway routing types

There are two gateway routing types:

- **Policy-based:** Policy-based gateways were previously called *Static Gateways*. The functionality of a static gateway has not changed, even though the name has changed. This type of gateway supports policy-based VPNs. Policy-based VPNs direct packets through IPsec tunnels with traffic selectors based on the combinations of address prefixes between your on-premises network and your Azure VNet. The traffic selectors or policies are usually defined as an access list in your VPN configurations.
 
- **Route-based:** Route-based gateways were previously called *Dynamic Gateways*. The functionality of a dynamic gateway has not changed, even though the name has changed. Route-based gateways implement route-based VPNs. Route-based VPNs use "routes" in the IP forwarding or routing table to direct packets into their corresponding VPN tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interfaces then encrypt or decrypt the packets in and out of the tunnels. The policy or traffic selector for route-based VPNs are configured as any-to-any (or wild cards).

Some connections (such as Point-to-Site and VNet-to-VNet) will only work with a specific gateway routing type. You'll see the gateway requirements listed in the article that corresponds to the connection scenario you want to create. 

VPN devices also have configuration limitations. When you create a VPN gateway, you'll select the gateway routing type that is required for your connection, making sure to verify that the VPN device you plan to use also supports that routing type. See [About VPN devices](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md) for more information.

For example, if you plan to use a Site-to-Site connection concurrently with a Point-to-Site connection, youâ€™ll need to configure a route-based VPN gateway. While it's true that Site-to-Site connections will work with policy-based gateways, Point-to-Site connections require a route-based gateway type. Because both connections will go over the same gateway, you'll have to select the gateway type that supports both. Additionally, the VPN device you use must also support route-based configurations.


## Gateway requirements

The table below lists the requirements for both static and dynamic VPN gateways.
