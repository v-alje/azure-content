# Log in to Azure Stack POC

There are two ways to log in to the Azure Stack POC.

## Log in as a service administrator

A service administrator manages resource providers, tenant offers, plans, services, quotas, and pricing.

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack POC physical machine.

2.  Double-click the **ClientVM.AzureStack.local.rdp** desktop icon to open a Remote Desktop Connection to the client virtual machine. This automatically uses the AzureStack\\AzureStackUser account that was created by the deployment script. Use the admin password you gave in step 5 of the script process at the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt.

3.  On the ClientVM.AzureStack.local desktop, double-click **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** icon (https://portal.azurestack.local/).

4.  Log in using the service administrator account.

## Log in as a tenant
Tenants provision, monitor, and manage services that they subscribe to, like Web Apps, storage, and virtual machines. A service administrator can log in as a tenant to test the plans, offers, and subscriptions that their tenants might use.
If you donâ€™t already have one, [Create a tenant account](azure-stack-add-new-user-aad.md) before you log in.

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine.

2.  Double-click the **ClientVM.AzureStack.local.rdp** desktop icon to open a Remote Desktop Connection to the client virtual machine. This automatically uses the AzureStack\\AzureStackUser account that was created by the deployment script. Use the admin password you gave in step 5 of the script process at the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt.

3.  On the ClientVM.AzureStack.local desktop, double-click **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** icon (https://portal.azurestack.local/).

4.  Log in using a tenant account.

RDP may restrict how many users can access the physical Microsoft Azure POC host. To enable multiple users, see [Enable multiple concurrent user connections](azure-stack-enable-multiple-concurrent-users.md).
