# What is Azure Stack Technical Preview 1?

Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview 1 release is being made available through a Proof of Concept (POC). The POC is an environment for learning and demonstrating Azure Stack features. It lets you deploy all required components on a single physical machine where you’ll have an ideal developer environment for evaluating features and validating the Azure Stack extensibility model for APIs.

## Scope of Azure Stack POC

-   Azure Stack POC must not be used as a production environment. Since the Azure Stack POC is single machine environment, it does not provide high-availability features. You might have data loss in the POC deployment due the risk of a pre-release environment.

-   Your deployment of Azure Stack is associated with a single Azure Active Directory directory. You can create multiple users in this directory and assign subscriptions to each user.

-   With all components deployed on the single machine, there are limited physical resources available for tenant resources. This configuration is not intended for scale and performance evaluation.

-   Networking scenarios are limited due to the single host/NIC requirement.
