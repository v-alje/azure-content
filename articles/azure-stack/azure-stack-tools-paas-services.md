# Tools and PaaS services for Azure Stack

Azure Stack enables deploying Platform as a Service (PaaS) services from Microsoft and other 3rd party providers. You can also download the tools described below. If you want to be notified of new services and tools, follow #AzureStack on Twitter.

## Additional PaaS services
In Technical Preview 1, the first of the App Service services - Web Apps, along with a set of web data services will be available for deployment on top of Azure Stack. This will provide the same Azure experience for deploying Web Apps using SQL or MySQL data.

## Template tools


### Azure Stack Github templates
Explore the growing collection of [Azure Stack GitHub Templates](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates). Just like [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates), these “Quick Start” Azure Resource Manager templates aim to get you started with simple building blocks and examples, ready to deploy on the Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview Proof of Concept Environment. Included are first party workload examples for [ad-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/ad-non-ha), [sql-2014-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/sql-2014-non-ha), [sharepoint-2013-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/sharepoint-2013-non-ha), as well as several simple 101 templates like [101-simple-windows-vm](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/101-simple-windows-vm).


### Marketplace item packaging tool and sample
[Download and use the Packaging tool](http://www.aka.ms/azurestackmarketplaceitem) to create marketplace items for your own custom templates to add to the Azure Stack marketplace. Instructions on how to create a marketplace item and make it available to your tenants can be found in [Create Marketplace item](azure-stack-create-marketplace-item.md).

## Developer tools
