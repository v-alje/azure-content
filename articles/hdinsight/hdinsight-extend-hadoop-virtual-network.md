#Extend HDInsight capabilities by using Azure Virtual Network

Azure Virtual Network allows you to extend your Hadoop solutions to incorporate on-premises resources such as SQL Server, or to create secure private networks between resources in the cloud.

> [AZURE.NOTE] HDInsight does not support affinity-based Azure virtual networks. When using HDInsight, you must use location-based virtual networks.


##<a id="whatis"></a>What is Azure Virtual Network?

[Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/) allows you to create a secure, persistent network containing the resources you need for your solution. A virtual network allows you to:

* Connect cloud resources together in a private network (cloud-only).

	![diagram of cloud-only configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/cloud-only.png)

	Using Virtual Network to link Azure services with Azure HDInsight enables the following scenarios:

	* **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from Azure websites or services running in Azure virtual machines.

	* **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, or another data storage solution running on a virtual machine.

	* **Combining multiple HDInsight servers** into a single solution. An example is using an HDInsight Storm server to consume incoming data, and then storing the processed data to an HDInsight HBase server. The raw data might also be stored to an HDInsight Hadoop server for future analysis by using MapReduce.

* Connect your cloud resources to your local datacenter network (site-to-site or point-to-site) by using a virtual private network (VPN).

	Site-to-site configuration allows you to connect multiple resources from your datacenter to the Azure virtual network by using a hardware VPN or the Routing and Remote Access service.

	![diagram of site-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/site-to-site.png)

	Point-to-site configuration allows you to connect a specific resource to the Azure virtual network by using software VPN.

	![diagram of point-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/point-to-site.png)

	Using Virtual Network to link the cloud and your datacenter enables similar scenarios to the cloud-only configuration. But instead of being limited to working with resources in the cloud, you can also work with resources in your datacenter.

	* **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and your datacenter. An example is using Sqoop to transfer data to or from SQL Server or reading data generated by a line-of-business (LOB) application.

	* **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from an LOB application. An example is using HBase Java APIs to store and retrieve data from an HDInsight HBase cluster.

For more information on Virtual Network features, benefits, and capabilities, see the [Azure Virtual Network overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE] You must create the Azure Virtual Network before provisioning an HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/).

## Virtual Network requirements

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Creating an HDInsight cluster on a Virtual Network requires specific Virtual Network configurations, which are described in this section.

###Location-based Virtual networks

Azure HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and does not currently work with virtual networks based on affinity group. 

###Subnets

It is highly recommended that you create a single subnet for each HDInsight cluster. 

###Classic or v2 Virtual Network

Windows-based clusters require a v1 (Classic) Virtual Network, while Linux-based clusters require a v2 (Azure Resource Manager,) Virtual Network. If you do not have the correct type of network, it will not be usable when you create the cluster.

If you have resources on a Virtual Network that is not usable by the cluster you plan on creating, you can create a new Virtual Network that is usable by the cluster, and connect it to the incompatible Virtual Network. You can then create the cluster in the network version that it requires, and it will be able to access resources in the other network since the two are joined. For more information on connecting classic and new Virtual Networks, see [Connecting classic VNets to new VNets](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-arm-asm-s2s.md).

###Secured Virtual Networks

HDInsight is not supported on Azure Virtual Networks that explicitly restrict access to/from the Internet. For example, using Network Security Groups or ExpressRoute to block Internet traffic to resources in the Virtual Network. The HDInsight service is a managed service, and requires Internet access during provisioning and while running so that Azure can monitor the health of the cluster, initiate failover of cluster resources, and other automated management tasks.

If you want to use HDInsight on a Virtual Network that blocks Internet traffic, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new subnet within the Virtual Network. By default, the new subnet will be able to communicate with the Internet. This allows HDInsight to be installed on this subnet. Since the new subnet is in the same virtual network as the secured subnet(s), it can also communicate with resources installed there.

2. Create the HDInsight cluster. When configuring the Virtual Network settings for the cluster, select the subnet created in step 1.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The above steps assume that you have not restricted communications to IP addresses _within the Virtual Network IP address range_. If you have, you may need to modify these restrictions to allow communication with the new subnet.

If you are unsure whether you have applied restrictions to the subnet that you want to install HDInsight into, or want to remove restrictions from the subnet, use the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Selecting the Virtual Network.

3. Select __Properties__.

4. Select __Subnets__, and then select the specific subnet. On the blade for this subnet, the __Network security group__ and __Route table__ entries will be set to a value of __None__ if no restrictions have been applied.

    If restrictions have been applied, you can remove the restriction by selecting the __Network security group__ or __Route table__ entry, and then selecting __None__. Finally, select __Save__ from the Subnet blade to save the changes.

##<a id="tasks"></a>Tasks and information

This section contains information on common tasks and information you may need when using HDInsight with a virtual network.

###Determine the FQDN

The HDInsight cluster will be assigned a specific fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Virtual Network interface. This is the address that you should use when connecting to the cluster from other resources on the virtual network. To determine the FQDN, use the following to URL to query the Ambari management service:

	https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/<servicename>/components/<componentname>

> [AZURE.NOTE] For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).

You must specify the cluster name and a service and component running on the cluster, such as the YARN resource manager.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The data returned is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document that contains a lot of information about the component. To extract just the FQDN, you should use a JSON parser to retrieve the `host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name` value.

For example, to return the FQDN from an HDInsight Hadoop cluster, you can use one of the following methods to retrieve the data for the YARN resource manager:

* [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md)

		$ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
		$Username = <cluster admin username>
		$Password = <cluster admin password>
		$DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
		$ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix

		$webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
		$webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)

		$Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/services/yarn/		components/resourcemanager"
		$Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
		$JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
		$FQDN = $JsonObject.host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name
		Write-host $FQDN

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

		curl -G -u <username>:<password> https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/yarn/components/resourcemanager | jq .host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name

###Connecting to HBase

To connect to HBase remotely by using the Java API, you must determine the ZooKeeper quorum addresses for the HBase cluster and specify this in your application.

To get the ZooKeeper quorum address, use one of the following methods to query the Ambari management service:

* [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md)

		$ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
		$Username = <cluster admin username>
		$Password = <cluster admin password>
		$DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
		$ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix

		$webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
		$webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)

		$Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum"
        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-host $JsonObject.items[0].properties.'hbase.zookeeper.quorum'

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

		curl -G -u <username>:<password> "https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum" | jq .items[0].properties[]

> [AZURE.NOTE] For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).

Once you have the quorum information, use it in your client application.

For example, for a Java application that uses the HBase API, you would add an **hbase-site.xml** file to the project and specify the quorum information in the file as follows:

```
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>zookeeper0.address,zookeeper1.address,zookeeper2.address</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>2181</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

###Verify network connectivity

Some services, such as SQL Server, can limit incoming network connections. This will prevent HDInsight from successfully working with these services.

If you encounter problems accessing a service from HDInsight, consult the documentation for the service to ensure that you have enabled network access. You can also verify network access by creating an Azure virtual machine on the same virtual network, and use client utilities to verify that the virtual machine can connect to the service over the virtual network.
