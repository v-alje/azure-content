This article shows you how to populate an index using the [Azure Search .NET SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn951165.aspx). The content below is a subset of the [How to use Azure Search from a .NET Application](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md). Refer to the parent article for end-to-end steps.

Prerequisites to importing data to an index include having a previously created index. 

Assuming an index named 'hotels', you can construct a method for importing data as follows.

The next step in `Main` is to populate the newly-created index. This is done in the following method:

    private static void UploadDocuments(SearchIndexClient indexClient)
    {
        var documents =
            new Hotel[]
            {
                new Hotel()
                { 
                    HotelId = "1058-441", 
                    HotelName = "Fancy Stay", 
                    BaseRate = 199.0, 
                    Category = "Luxury", 
                    Tags = new[] { "pool", "view", "concierge" }, 
                    ParkingIncluded = false, 
                    LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(2010, 6, 27, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero), 
                    Rating = 5, 
                    Location = GeographyPoint.Create(47.678581, -122.131577)
                },
                new Hotel()
                { 
                    HotelId = "666-437", 
                    HotelName = "Roach Motel",
                    BaseRate = 79.99,
                    Category = "Budget",
                    Tags = new[] { "motel", "budget" },
                    ParkingIncluded = true,
                    LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(1982, 4, 28, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero),
                    Rating = 1,
                    Location = GeographyPoint.Create(49.678581, -122.131577)
                },
                new Hotel() 
                { 
                    HotelId = "970-501", 
                    HotelName = "Econo-Stay",
                    BaseRate = 129.99,
                    Category = "Budget",
                    Tags = new[] { "pool", "budget" },
                    ParkingIncluded = true,
                    LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(1995, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero),
                    Rating = 4,
                    Location = GeographyPoint.Create(46.678581, -122.131577)
                },
                new Hotel()
                { 
                    HotelId = "956-532", 
                    HotelName = "Express Rooms",
                    BaseRate = 129.99,
                    Category = "Budget",
                    Tags = new[] { "wifi", "budget" },
                    ParkingIncluded = true,
                    LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(1995, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero),
                    Rating = 4,
                    Location = GeographyPoint.Create(48.678581, -122.131577)
                },
                new Hotel() 
                { 
                    HotelId = "566-518", 
                    HotelName = "Surprisingly Expensive Suites",
                    BaseRate = 279.99,
                    Category = "Luxury",
                    ParkingIncluded = false
                }
            };

        try
        {
            var batch = IndexBatch.Upload(sitecoreItems);
            indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);
        }
        catch (IndexBatchException e)
        {
            // Sometimes when your Search service is under load, indexing will fail for some of the documents in
            // the batch. Depending on your application, you can take compensating actions like delaying and
            // retrying. For this simple demo, we just log the failed document keys and continue.
            Console.WriteLine(
                "Failed to index some of the documents: {0}",
                String.Join(", ", e.IndexingResults.Where(r => !r.Succeeded).Select(r => r.Key)));
        }

        // Wait a while for indexing to complete.
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
    }

This method has four parts. The first creates an array of `Hotel` objects that will serve as our input data to upload to the index. This data is hard-coded for simplicity. In your own application, your data will likely come from an external data source such as a SQL database.

The second part creates an `IndexAction` for each `Hotel`, then groups those together in a new `IndexBatch`. The batch is then uploaded to the Azure Search index by the `Documents.Index` method.

> [AZURE.NOTE] In this example, we are just uploading documents. If you wanted to merge changes into an existing document or delete a document, you could use corresponding `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload` or `Delete` methods accordingly.

The third part of this method is a catch block that handles an important error case for indexing. If your Azure Search service fails to index some of the documents in the batch, an `IndexBatchException` is thrown by `Documents.Index`. This can happen if you are indexing documents while your service is under heavy load. **We strongly recommend explicitly handling this case in your code.** You can delay and then retry indexing the documents that failed, or you can log and continue like the sample does, or you can do something else depending on your application's data consistency requirements.

Finally, the method delays for two seconds. Indexing happens asynchronously in your Azure Search service, so the sample application needs to wait a short time to ensure that the documents are available for searching. Delays like this are typically only necessary in demos, tests, and sample applications.
