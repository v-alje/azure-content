# Choose a framework for your service

Azure Service Fabric offers two high-level frameworks for building services: the Reliable Services API and the Reliable Actors API. While both are built on the same Service Fabric core, they make different tradeoffs between simplicity and flexibility in terms of concurrency, partitioning, and communication. It is useful to understand both models so that you can choose the appropriate framework for a particular service within your application.

## Comparing the Reliable Actors API and the Reliable Services API

|**When to choose Reliable Actors API**|**When to choose Reliable Services API**|
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
|Your problem space involves a large number (1000+) of small, independent units of state and logic.|You need to maintain logic across multiple components.|
|You want to work with single-threaded objects that do not require significant external interaction.|You want to use Reliable Collections (like .NET Reliable Dictionary and Reliable Queue) to store and manage your state.|
|You want the platform to manage communication for you.|You want to manage communication and control the partitioning scheme for your service.|

Keep in mind that it is perfectly reasonable to use different frameworks for different services within your app. For instance, you might have a stateful service that aggregates data that is generated by a number of actors.
