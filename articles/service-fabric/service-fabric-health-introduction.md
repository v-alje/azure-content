# Introduction to Service Fabric health monitoring
Azure Service Fabric introduces a health model that provides rich, flexible, and extensible health evaluation and reporting. This includes near-real-time monitoring of the state of the cluster and the services running in it. You can easily obtain health information and take actions to correct potential issues before they cascade and cause massive outages. In the typical model, services send reports based on their local views, and that information is aggregated to provide an overall cluster-level view.

Service Fabric components use this health model to report their current state. You can use the same mechanism to report health from your applications. The quality and richness of the health reporting that is specific to your custom conditions determine how easily you will be able to detect and fix issues for your running application.

> [AZURE.NOTE] We started the health subsystem to address a need for monitored upgrades. Service Fabric provides monitored upgrades that know how to upgrade a cluster or an application with no downtime and minimal to no user intervention, and with full cluster and application availability. To do this, the upgrade checks health based on configured upgrade policies and allows an upgrade to proceed only when health respects desired thresholds. Otherwise, the upgrade is either automatically rolled back or paused to give administrators a chance to fix the issues. To learn more about application upgrades, see [this article](service-fabric-application-upgrade.md).

## Health store
The health store keeps health-related information about entities in the cluster for easy retrieval and evaluation. It is implemented as a Service Fabric persisted stateful service to ensure high availability and scalability. The health store is part of the **fabric:/System** application, and it is available as soon as the cluster is up and running.

## Health entities and hierarchy
The health entities are organized in a logical hierarchy that captures interactions and dependencies among different entities. The entities and hierarchy are automatically built by the health store based on reports received from Service Fabric components.

The health entities mirror the Service Fabric entities. (For example, **health application entity** matches an application instance deployed in the cluster, while **health node entity** matches a Service Fabric cluster node.) The health hierarchy captures the interactions of the system entities, and it is the basis for advanced health evaluation. You can learn about key Service Fabric concepts in [Service Fabric technical overview](service-fabric-technical-overview.md). For more on application, see [Service Fabric application model](service-fabric-application-model.md).

The health entities and hierarchy allow the cluster and applications to be effectively reported, debugged, and monitored. The health model provides an accurate, *granular* representation of the health of the many moving pieces in the cluster.

The health entities are:

- **Cluster**. Represents the health of a Service Fabric cluster. Cluster health reports describe conditions that affect the entire cluster and can't be narrowed down to one or more unhealthy children. Examples include the brain of the cluster splitting due to network partitioning or communication issues.

- **Node**. Represents the health of a Service Fabric node. Node health reports describe conditions that affect the node functionality. They typically affect all the deployed entities running on it. Examples include when a node is out of disk space (or another machine-wide property, such as memory, connections) and when a node is down. The node entity is identified by the node name (string).

- **Application**. Represents the health of an application instance running in the cluster. Application health reports describe conditions that affect the overall health of the application. They can't be narrowed down to individual children (services or deployed applications). Examples include the end-to-end interaction among different services in the application. The application entity is identified by the application name (URI).

- **Service**. Represents the health of a service running in the cluster. Service health reports describe conditions that affect the overall health of the service, and they can't be narrowed down to a partition or a replica. Examples include a service configuration (such as port or external file share) that is causing issues for all partitions. The service entity is identified by the service name (URI).

- **Partition**. Represents the health of a service partition. Partition health reports describe conditions that affect the entire replica set. Examples include when the number of replicas is below target count and when a partition is in quorum loss. The partition entity is identified by the partition ID (GUID).

- **Replica**. Represents the health of a stateful service replica or a stateless service instance. This is the smallest unit that watchdogs and system components can report on for an application. For stateful services, examples include a primary replica reporting when it can't replicate operations to secondaries and when replication is not proceeding at the expected pace. Also, a stateless instance can report when it is running out of resources or has connectivity issues. The replica entity is identified by the partition ID (GUID) and the replica or instance ID (long).

- **DeployedApplication**. Represents the health of an *application running on a node*. Deployed application health reports describe conditions specific to the application on the node that can't be narrowed down to service packages deployed on the same node. Examples include when the application package can't be downloaded on that node and when there is an issue setting up application security principals on the node. The deployed application is identified by application name (URI) and node name (string).

- **DeployedServicePackage**. Represents the health of a service package of an application running in a node in the cluster. It describes conditions specific to a service package that do not affect the other service packages on the same node for the same application. Examples include a code package in the service package that cannot be started and a configuration package that cannot be read. The deployed service package is identified by application name (URI), node name (string), and service manifest name (string).

The granularity of the health model makes it easy to detect and correct issues. For example, if a service is not responding, it is feasible to report that the application instance is unhealthy. This is not ideal, however, because the issue might not be affecting all the services within that application. The report should be applied to the unhealthy service or to a specific child partition, if more information points to that partition. The data will automatically surface through the hierarchy, and an unhealthy partition will be made visible at service and application levels. This will help pinpoint and resolve the root cause of the issue more quickly.

The health hierarchy is composed of parent-child relationships. A cluster is composed of nodes and applications. Applications have services and deployed applications. Deployed applications have deployed service packages. Services have partitions, and each partition has one or more replicas. There is a special relationship between nodes and deployed entities. If a node is unhealthy as reported by its authority system component (Failover Manager service), it will affect the deployed applications, service packages, and replicas deployed on it.

The health hierarchy represents the latest state of the system based on the latest health reports, which is almost real-time information.
Internal and external watchdogs can report on the same entities based on application-specific logic or on custom monitored conditions. User reports coexist with the system reports.

As you design a large cloud service, the time that you invest in planning how to report and respond to health can make the service easier to debug, monitor, and subsequently operate.

## Health states
Service Fabric uses three health states to describe whether an entity is healthy or not: OK, warning, and error. Any report sent to the health store must specify one of these states. The health evaluation result is one of these states.

The possible health states are:

- **OK**. The entity is healthy. There are no known issues reported on it or its children (when applicable).

- **Warning**. The entity experiences some issues, but it is not yet unhealthy (i.e., no unexpected delay is causing any functional issues). In some cases, the warning condition may fix itself without any special intervention, and it is useful to provide visibility into what is going on. In other cases, the warning condition may degrade into a severe problem without user intervention.

- **Error**. The entity is unhealthy. Action should be taken to fix the state of the entity, because it can't function properly.

- **Unknown**. The entity doesn't exist in the health store. This result can be obtained from the distributed queries that merge results from multiple components. These can include the query to get the list of Service Fabric nodes, which goes to **FailoverManager** and **HealthManager**, or the query to get the list of applications, which goes to **ClusterManager** and **HealthManager**. These queries merge results from multiple system components. If another system component has an entity that has not yet reached the health store or that has been cleaned up from the health store, the merged query will populate the health result with the unknown health state.

## Health policies
The health store applies health policies to determine whether an entity is healthy based on its reports and its children.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Health policies can be specified in the cluster manifest (for cluster and node health evaluation) or in the application manifest (for application evaluation and any of its children). Health evaluation requests can also pass in custom health evaluation policies, which will be used only for that evaluation.

By default, Service Fabric applies strict rules (everything must be healthy) for the parent-child hierarchical relationship. If even one of the children has one unhealthy event, the parent is considered unhealthy.

### Cluster health policy
The cluster health policy is used to evaluate the cluster health state and node health states. The policy can be defined in the cluster manifest. If it is not present, the default policy (zero tolerated failures) is used.
The cluster health policy contains:

- **ConsiderWarningAsError**. Specifies whether to treat warning health reports as errors during health evaluation. Default: false.

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error. In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

The following is an excerpt from a cluster manifest:

```xml
<FabricSettings>
  <Section Name="HealthManager/ClusterHealthPolicy">
    <Parameter Name="ConsiderWarningAsError" Value="False" />
    <Parameter Name="MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications" Value="0" />
    <Parameter Name="MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes" Value="20" />
  </Section>
</FabricSettings>
```

### Application health policy
The application health policy describes how the evaluation of events and child-states aggregation is done for applications and their children. It can be defined in the application manifest, **ApplicationManifest.xml**, in the application package. If no policies are specified, Service Fabric assumes that the entity is unhealthy if it has a health report or a child at the warning or error health state.
The configurable policies are:

- **ConsiderWarningAsError**. Specifies whether to treat warning health reports as errors during health evaluation. Default: false.

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyDeployedApplications**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error. This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed applications over the number of nodes that the applications are currently deployed on in the cluster. The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage: zero.

- **DefaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy**. Specifies the default service type health policy, which will replace the default health policy for all service types in the application.

- **ServiceTypeHealthPolicyMap**. Provides a map of service health policies per service type. These replace the default service type health policies for each specified service type. For example, in an application that contains both a stateless gateway service type and a stateful engine service type, the health policies for the stateless and stateful services can be configured differently. When you specify policy per service type, you can gain more granular control of the health of the service.

### Service type health policy
The service type health policy specifies how to evaluate and aggregate the children of services. The policy contains:

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of unhealthy partitions before a service is considered unhealthy. Default percentage: zero.

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of unhealthy replicas before a partition is considered unhealthy. Default percentage: zero.

- **MaxPercentUnhealthyServices**. Specifies the maximum tolerated percentage of unhealthy services before the application is considered unhealthy. Default percentage: zero.

The following is an excerpt from an application manifest:

```xml
    <Policies>
        <HealthPolicy ConsiderWarningAsError="true" MaxPercentUnhealthyDeployedApplications="20">
            <DefaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyServices="0"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService="10"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition="0"/>
            <ServiceTypeHealthPolicy ServiceTypeName="FrontEndServiceType"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyServices="0"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService="20"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition="0"/>
            <ServiceTypeHealthPolicy ServiceTypeName="BackEndServiceType"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyServices="20"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService="0"
                   MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition="0">
            </ServiceTypeHealthPolicy>
        </HealthPolicy>
    </Policies>
```

## Health evaluation
Users and automated services can evaluate health for any entity at any time. To evaluate an entity's health, the health store aggregates all health reports on the entity and evaluates all of its children (when applicable). The health aggregation algorithm uses health policies that specify how to evaluate health reports and how to aggregate child health states (when applicable).

### Health report aggregation
One entity can have multiple health reports sent by different reporters (system components or watchdogs) on different properties. The aggregation uses the associated health policies, in particular the ConsiderWarningAsError member of application or cluster health policy. This specifies how to evaluate warnings.

The aggregated health state is triggered by the *worst* health reports on the entity. If there is at least one error health report, the aggregated health state is an error.

![Health report aggregation with error report.][2]

An error health report triggers the health entity to be in the error state.

[2]: ./media/service-fabric-health-introduction/servicefabric-health-report-eval-error.png

If there are no error reports and one or more warnings, the aggregated health state is either warning or error, depending on the ConsiderWarningAsError policy flag.

![Health report aggregation with warning report and ConsiderWarningAsError false.][3]

Health report aggregation with warning report and ConsiderWarningAsError set to false (default).

[3]: ./media/service-fabric-health-introduction/servicefabric-health-report-eval-warning.png

### Child health aggregation
The aggregated health state of an entity reflects the child health states (when applicable). The algorithm for aggregating child health states uses the health policies applicable based on the entity type.

![Child entities health aggregation.][4]

Child aggregation based on health policies.

[4]: ./media/service-fabric-health-introduction/servicefabric-health-hierarchy-eval.png

After the health store has evaluated all of the children, it aggregates their health states based on the configured maximum percentage of unhealthy children. This is taken from the policy based on the entity and child type.

- If all children have OK states, the child aggregated health state is OK.

- If children have both OK and warning states, the child aggregated health state is warning.

- If there are children with error states that do not respect the maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy children, the aggregated health state is an error.

- If the children with error states respect the maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy children, the aggregated health state is warning.

## Health reporting
System components and internal/external watchdogs can report against Service Fabric entities. The reporters make *local* determinations of the health of the monitored entities, based on the conditions they are monitoring. They don't need to look at any global state or aggregate data. This is not desired, as it would make the reporters complex organisms that need to look at many things to infer what information to send.

To send health data to the health store, a reporter needs to identify the affected entity and create a health report. The report can then be sent through the API by using **FabricClient.HealthManager.ReportHealth**, through PowerShell, or through REST.

### Health reports
The health reports for each of the entities in the cluster contain the following information:

- **SourceId**. A string that uniquely identifies the reporter of the health event.

- **Entity identifier**. Identifies the entity where the report is applied. It differs based on the [entity type](service-fabric-health-introduction.md#health-entities-and-hierarchy):

  - Cluster. None.

  - Node. Node name  (string).

  - Application. Application name (URI). Represents the name of the application instance deployed in the cluster.

  - Service. Service name (URI). Represents the name of the service instance deployed in the cluster.

  - Partition. Partition ID (GUID). Represents the partition unique identifier.

  - Replica. The stateful service replica ID or the stateless service instance ID (INT64).

  - DeployedApplication. Application name (URI) and node name (string).

  - DeployedServicePackage. Application name (URI), node name (string), and service manifest name (string).

- **Property**. A *string* (not a fixed enumeration) that allows the reporter to categorize the health event for a specific property of the entity. For example, reporter A can report the health of the Node01 "storage" property and reporter B can report the health of the Node01 "connectivity" property. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the Node01 entity.

- **Description**. A string that allows a reporter to provide detailed information about the health event. **SourceId**, **Property**, and **HealthState** should fully describe the report. The description adds human-readable information about the report. This makes it easier for administrators and users to understand.

- **HealthState**. An [enumeration](service-fabric-health-introduction.md#health-states) that describes the health state of the report. The accepted values are OK, Warning, and Error.

- **TimeToLive**. A timespan that indicates how long the health report is valid. Coupled with **RemoveWhenExpired**, it lets the health store know how to evaluate expired events. By default, the value is infinite, and the report is valid forever.

- **RemoveWhenExpired**. A Boolean. If this is set to true, the expired health report is automatically removed from the health store, and the report doesn't impact entity health evaluation. This is used when the report is valid for a specified period of time only, and the reporter doesn't need to explicitly clear it out. It's also used to delete reports from the health store (for example, a watchdog is changed and stops sending reports with previous source and property). It can send a report with a brief TimeToLive along with RemoveWhenExpired to clear up any previous state from the health store. If the value is set to false, the expired report is treated as an error on the health evaluation. The false value signals to the health store that the source should report periodically on this property. If it doesn't, then there must be something wrong with the watchdog. The watchdog's health is captured by considering the event as an error.

- **SequenceNumber**. A positive integer that needs to be ever-increasing, it represents the order of the reports. It is used by the health store to detect stale reports that are received late because of network delays or other issues. A report is rejected if the sequence number is less than or equal to the most recently applied number for the same entity, source, and property. If it is not specified, the sequence number is generated automatically. It is necessary to put in the sequence number only when reporting on state transitions. In this situation, the source needs to remember which reports it sent and keep the information for recovery on failover.

These four pieces of information--SourceId, entity identifier, Property, and HealthState--are required for every health report. The SourceId string is not allowed to start with the prefix "**System.**", which is reserved for system reports. For the same entity, there is only one report for the same source and property. If multiple reports are generated for the same source and property, they override each other, either on the health client side (if they are batched) or on the health store side. The replacement is based on sequence numbers; newer reports (with higher sequence numbers) replace older reports.

### Health events
Internally, the health store keeps health events, which contain all the information from the reports, as well as additional metadata. This includes the time the report was given to the health client and the time it was modified on the server side. The health events are returned by [health queries](service-fabric-view-entities-aggregated-health.md#health-queries).

The added metadata contains:

- **SourceUtcTimestamp**. The time the report was given to the health client (Coordinated Universal Time).

- **LastModifiedUtcTimestamp**. The time the report was last modified on the server side (Coordinated Universal Time).

- **IsExpired**. A flag to indicate whether the report was expired when the query was executed by the health store. An event can be expired only if RemoveWhenExpired is false. Otherwise, the event is not returned by query and is removed from the store.

- **LastOkTransitionAt**, **LastWarningTransitionAt**, **LastErrorTransitionAt**. The last time for OK/warning/error transitions. These fields give the history of the health state transitions for the event.

The state transition fields can be used for smarter alerts or "historical" health event information. They enable scenarios such as:

- Alert when a property has been at warning/error for more than X minutes. This avoids alerts on temporary conditions. For example, an alert if the health state has been warning for more than five minutes can be translated into (HealthState == Warning and Now - LastWarningTransitionTime > 5 minutes).

- Alert only on conditions that have changed in the last X minutes. If a report was already at error before the specified time, it can be ignored because it was already signaled previously.

- If a property is toggling between warning and error, determine how long it has been unhealthy (i.e. not OK). For example, an alert if the property hasn't been healthy for more than five minutes can be translated into (HealthState != Ok and Now - LastOkTransitionTime > 5 minutes).

## Example: Report and evaluate application health
The following example sends a health report through PowerShell on the application **fabric:/WordCount** from the source **MyWatchdog**. The health report contains information about the health property availability in an error health state, with infinite TimeToLive. Then it queries the application health, which returns aggregated health state errors and the reported health events in the list of health events.

```powershell
PS C:\> Send-ServiceFabricApplicationHealthReport –ApplicationName fabric:/WordCount –SourceId "MyWatchdog" –HealthProperty "Availability" –HealthState Error

PS C:\> Get-ServiceFabricApplicationHealth fabric:/WordCount

## Health model usage
The health model allows cloud services and the underlying Service Fabric platform to scale, because monitoring and health determinations are distributed among the different monitors within the cluster.
Other systems have a single, centralized service at the cluster level that parses all of the *potentially* useful information emitted by services. This approach hinders their scalability. It also doesn't allow them to collect very specific information to help identify issues and potential issues as close to the root cause as possible.

The health model is used heavily for monitoring and diagnosis, for evaluating cluster and application health, and for monitored upgrades. Other services use health data to perform automatic repairs, build cluster health history, and issue alerts on certain conditions.
