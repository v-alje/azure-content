# Service remoting with Reliable Services
For services that are not tied to a particular communication protocol or stack, such as WebAPI, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), or others, the framework provides a remoting mechanism to quickly and easily set up a remote procedure call for services.

## Set up remoting on a service
Setting up remoting for a service is done in two simple steps:

1. Create an interface for your service to implement. This interface defines the methods that will be available for a remote procedure call on your service. The methods must be task-returning asynchronous methods. The interface must implement `Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.IService` to signal that the service has a remoting interface.
2. Use `Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.Runtime.ServiceRemotingListener` in your service. This is an `ICommunicationListener` implementation that provides remoting capabilities.

For example, this Hello World service exposes a single method to get "Hello World" over a remote procedure call:

```csharp
public interface IHelloWorldStateful : IService
{
    Task<string> GetHelloWorld();
}

internal class HelloWorldStateful : StatefulService, IHelloWorldStateful
{
    protected override IEnumerable<ServiceReplicaListener> CreateServiceReplicaListeners()
    {
        return new[] { new ServiceReplicaListener(parameters => new ServiceRemotingListener<HelloWorldStateful>(parameters, this)) };
    }

    public Task<string> GetHelloWorld()
    {
        return Task.FromResult("Hello World!");
    }
}

```
> [AZURE.NOTE] The arguments and the return types in the service interface can be any simple, complex, or custom types, but they must be serializable by the .NET [DataContractSerializer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms731923.aspx).


## Call remote service methods
Calling methods on a service by using the remoting stack is done by using a local proxy to the service through the `Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.Client.ServiceProxy` class. The `ServiceProxy` method creates a local proxy by using the same interface that the service implements. With that proxy, you can simply call methods on the interface remotely.


```csharp

IHelloWorldStateful helloWorldClient = ServiceProxy.Create<IHelloWorldStateful>(new Uri("fabric:/MyApplication/MyHelloWorldService"));

string message = await helloWorldClient.GetHelloWorld();

```

The remoting framework propagates exceptions thrown at the service to the client. So exception-handling logic at the client by using `ServiceProxy` can directly handle exceptions that the service throws.
