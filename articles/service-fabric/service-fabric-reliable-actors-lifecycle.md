# Actor lifecycle and garbage collection
An actor is activated when the first call is made to it. An actor is deactivated (garbage collected by the Actors runtime) if it is not used for some period of time. To configure this time period, see the section on Actor garbage collection below.

What happens on actor activation?

- When a call comes for an actor and one is not already active, a new actor is created.
- The actor's state is loaded (if it is a stateful actor).
- The `OnActivateAsync` method (which can be overridden in the actor implementation) is called.
- The actor is added to an Active Actors table.

What happens on actor deactivation?

- When an actor is not used for some period of time, it is removed from the Active Actors table.
- The `OnDeactivateAsync` method (which can be overridden in the actor implementation) is called. This clears all the timers for the actor.

> [AZURE.TIP] The Fabric Actors runtime emits some [events related to actor activation and deactivation](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#actor-activation-and-deactivation-events). They are useful in diagnostics and performance monitoring.

## Actor garbage collection
The Actors runtime periodically scans for actors that have not been used for some period of time, and it deactivates them. Once the actors are deactivated, they can be garbage collected by the common language runtime (CLR).

What counts as “being used” for the purpose of garbage collection?

- Receiving a call
- `IRemindable.ReceiveReminderAsync` method being invoked (applicable only if the actor uses reminders)

It is worth noting that if the actor uses timers and its timer callback is invoked, it does **not** count as "being used".

Before we go into the details of garbage collection, it is important to define the following terms:

- *Scan interval*. This is the interval at which the Actors runtime scans its Active Actors table for actors that can be garbage collected. The default value for this is 1 minute.
- *Idle timeout*. This is the amount of time that an actor needs to remain unused (idle) before it can be garbage collected. The default value for this is 60 minutes.

Typically, you do not need to change these defaults. However, if necessary, these intervals can be changed at an assembly level for all actor types in that assembly or at an actor-type level by using the `ActorGarbageCollection` attribute. The example below shows the change in the garbage collection intervals for HelloActor.

```csharp
[ActorGarbageCollection(IdleTimeoutInSeconds = 10, ScanIntervalInSeconds = 2)]
class HelloActor : Actor, IHello
{
    public Task<string> SayHello(string greeting)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("You said: '" + greeting + "', I say: Hello Actors!");
    }
}
```

To change the default value of the `ActorGarbageCollection` attribute at the assembly level, add following snippet to `AssemblyInfo.cs`.

```csharp
[assembly: ActorGarbageCollection(IdleTimeoutInSeconds = 10, ScanIntervalInSeconds = 2)]
```

For each actor in its Active Actors table, the Actors runtime keeps track of the amount of time that it has been idle (i.e. not used). The Actors runtime checks each of the actors every `ScanIntervalInSeconds` to see if it can be garbage collected and collects it if it has been idle for `IdleTimeoutInSeconds`.

Anytime an actor is used, its idle time is reset to 0. After this, the actor can be garbage collected only if it again remains idle for `IdleTimeoutInSeconds`. Recall that an actor is considered to have been used if either an actor interface method an actor reminder callback is executed. An actor is **not** considered to have been used if its timer callback is executed.

The diagram below contains an example to illustrate these concepts.

![Example of idle time][1]

The example assumes that there is only one active actor in the Active Actors table. The example shows the impact of actor method calls, reminders, and timers on the lifetime of this actor. The following points about the example are worth mentioning:

- ScanInterval and IdleTimeout are set to 5 and 10 respectively. (Units do not matter here, since our purpose is only to illustrate the concept.)
- The scan for actors to be garbage collected happens at T=0,5,10,15,20,25, as defined by the scan interval of 5.
- A periodic timer fires at T=4,8,12,16,20,24, and its callback executes. It does not impact the idle time of the actor.
- An actor method call at T=7 resets the idle time to 0 and delays the garbage collection of the actor.
- An actor reminder callback executes at T=14 and further delays the garbage collection of the actor.
- During the garbage collection scan at T=25, the actor's idle time finally exceeds the idle timeout of 10, and the actor is garbage collected.

Note that an actor will never be garbage collected while it is executing one of its methods, no matter how much time is spent in executing that method. As mentioned earlier, the execution of actor interface methods and reminder callbacks prevents garbage collection by resetting the actor's idle time to 0. The execution of timer callbacks does not reset the idle time to 0. However, the garbage collection of the actor is deferred until the timer callback has completed execution.
