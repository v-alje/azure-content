# Get started using Windows Azure HDInsight

HDInsight makes [Apache Hadoop][apache-hadoop] available as a service in the cloud. It makes the MapReduce software framework available in a simpler, more scalable, and cost efficient Windows Azure environment. HDInsight also provides a cost efficient approach to the managing and storing of data using Windows Azure Blob storage. 

In this tutorial, you will provision an HDInsight cluster using the Windows Azure Management Portal, run a Hadoop MapReduce job using PowerShell, and then import the MapReduce job output data into Excel for examination.

In conjunction with the general availability of Windows Azure HDInsight, Microsoft has also released HDInsight Emulator for Windows Azure, formerly known as Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview. This product targets developer scenarios and as such only supports single-node deployments. For using HDInsight Emulator, see [Get Started with the HDInsight Emulator][hdinsight-emulator].

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following:


- A Windows Azure subscription. For more information about obtaining a subscription, see [Purchase Options][azure-purchase-options], [Member Offers][azure-member-offers], or [Free Trial][azure-free-trial].
- A computer that is running Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2.
- Office 2013 Professional Plus, Office 365 Pro Plus, Excel 2013 Standalone, or Office 2010 Professional Plus.

**Estimated time to complete:** 30 minutes

##In this tutorial

* [Set up local environment for running PowerShell](#setup)
* [Provision an HDInsight cluster](#provision)
* [Run a WordCount MapReduce program](#sample)
* [Connect to Microsoft business intelligence tools](#powerquery)
* [Next steps](#nextsteps)



##<a id="setup"></a> Set up local environment for running PowerShell

In this tutorial, you'll use Windows Azure PowerShell to run a MapReduce job. To install Windows Azure PowerShell, run the [Microsoft Web Platform Installer](web-platform-installer). Click **Run** when prompted, click **Install**, and then follow the instructions. For more information, see [Install and configure PowerShell for HDInsight](powershell-install-configure).

The PowerShell cmdlets require your subscription information so that it can be used to manage your services.

**To connect to your subscription using Windows Azure AD**

1. Open the Windows Azure PowerShell console, as instructed in [How to: Install Windows Azure PowerShell][powershell-open].
2. Run the following command:

		Add-AzureAccount

3. In the window, type the email address and password associated with your account. Windows Azure authenticates and saves the credential information, and then closes the window.

The other method to connect to  your subscription is using the certificate method. For instructions, see [Install and configure Windows Azure PowerShell][powershell-install-configure].
	
##<a name="provision"></a>Provision an HDInsight cluster

The HDInsight provision process requires a Windows Azure Storage account to be used as the default file system. The storage account must be located in the same data center as the HDInsight compute resources. Currently, you can only provision HDInsight clusters in the following data centers:

- Southeast Asia
- North Europe
- West Europe
- East US
- West US

You must choose one of the five data centers for your Windows Azure Storage account.

**To create a Windows Azure Storage account**

1. Sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal].
2. Click **NEW** on the lower left corner, point to **DATA SERVICES**, point to **STORAGE**, and then click **QUICK CREATE**.

	![HDI.StorageAccount.QuickCreate][image-hdi-storageaccount-quickcreate]

3. Enter **URL** and **LOCATION**, and then click **CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT**. You will see the new storage account in the storage list. Affinity groups are not supported.
4. Wait until the **STATUS** of the new storage account is changed to **Online**.
5. Click the new storage account from the list to select it.
6. Click **MANAGE ACCESS KEYS** from the bottom of the page.
7. Make a note of the **STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME** and the **PRIMARY ACCESS KEY**.  You will need them later in the tutorial.


For the detailed instructions, see
[How to Create a Storage Account][azure-create-storageaccount] and [Use Windows Azure Blob Storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].




















**To provision an HDInsight cluster** 

1. Sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal]. 

2. Click **HDInsight** on the left to list the status of the clusters in your account. In the following screenshot, there is no existing HDInsight cluster.

	![HDI.ClusterStatus][image-hdi-clusterstatus]

3. Click **NEW** on the lower left side, click **Data Services**, click **HDInsight**, and then click **Quick Create**.

	![HDI.QuickCreateCluster][image-hdi-quickcreatecluster]

4. Enter or select the following values:

	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Cluster Name</td><td>Name of the cluster</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Cluster Size</td><td>Number of data nodes you want to deploy. The default value is 4. But 8, 16 and 32 data node clusters are also available on the dropdown menu. Any number of data nodes may be specified when using the <strong>Custom Create</strong> option. Pricing details on the billing rates for various cluster sizes are available. Click the <strong>?</strong> symbol just above the dropdown box and follow the link on the pop up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Password (cluster admin)</td><td>The password for the account <i>admin</i>. The cluster user name is specified to be "admin" by default when using the Quick Create option. This can only be changed by using the <strong>Custom Create</strong> wizard. The password field must be at least 10 characters and must contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Storage Account</td><td>Select the storage account you created from the dropdown box. <br/>

	> [WACOM.NOTE]
        > Once a storage account is chosen, it cannot be changed. If the storage account is removed, the cluster will no longer be available for use.

	The HDInsight cluster location will be the same as the storage account.
	</td></tr>
	</table>


5. Click **Create HDInsight Cluster** on the lower right. When the provision process completes, the  status column will show **Running**.

For information on using the **CUSTOM CREATE** option, see [Provision HDInsight Clusters][hdinsight-provision].













##<a name="sample"></a>Run a WordCount MapReduce job

Now you have an HDInsight cluster provisioned. The next step is to run a MapReduce job to count words in an input file. The following diagram illustrates how MapReduce works for the word count scenario:

![HDI.WordCountDiagram][image-hdi-wordcountdiagram]



The output is a set of key-value pairs. The key is a string that specifies a word and the value is an integer that specifies the total number of occurrences of that word in the text. This is done in two stages: 

* The mapper takes each line from the input text as an input and breaks it into words. It emits a key/value pair each time a work occurs of the word followed by a 1. 

* The reducer then sums these individual counts for each word and emits a single key/value pair containing the word followed by the sum of its occurrences.

Running a MapReduce job requires the following elements:

* A MapReduce program. In this tutorial, you will use the WordCount sample that comes with the HDInsight cluster distribution so you don't need to write your own. It is located on */example/jars/hadoop-examples.jar*. For instructions on writing your own MapReduce job, see [Using MapReduce with HDInsight][hdinsight-mapreduce].
* An input file. You will use */example/data/gutenberg/davinci.txt* as the input file. For information on upload files, see [Upload Data to HDInsight][hdinsight-upload-data].
* An output file folder. You will use */example/data/WordCountOutput* as the output file folder. The system will create the folder if it doesn't exist.

The URI scheme for accessing files in Blob storage is:

	WASB[S]://<containername>@<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<path>

The URI scheme provides both unencrypted access with the *WASB:* prefix, and SSL encrypted access with WASBS. We recommend using WASBS wherever possible, even when accessing data that lives inside the same Windows Azure data center.

Because HDInsight uses a Blob Storage container as the default file system, you can refer to files and directories inside the default file system using relative or absolute paths.

For example, to access the hadoop-examples.jar, you can use one of the following options:

	● wasb://<containername>@<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/example/jars/hadoop-examples.jar
	● wasb:///example/jars/hadoop-examples.jar
	● /example/jars/hadoop-examples.jar
				
The use of the *wasb://* prefix in the paths of these files. This is needed to indicate Azure Blob Storage is being used for input and output files. The output directory assumes a default path relative to the *wasb:///user/&lt;username&gt;* folder. 

For more information, see [Use Windows Azure Blob Storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].





















**To run the WordCount sample**

1. Open **Windows Azure PowerShell**. For instructions of opening Windows Azure PowerShell console window, see [Install and configure Windows Azure PowerShell][powershell-install-configure].

3. Run the following commands to set the variables.  
		
		$subscriptionName = "<SubscriptionName>" 
		$clusterName = "<HDInsightClusterName>"        
		
5. Run the following commands to create a MapReduce job definition:

		# Define the MapReduce job
		$wordCountJobDefinition = New-AzureHDInsightMapReduceJobDefinition -JarFile "wasb:///example/jars/hadoop-examples.jar" -ClassName "wordcount" -Arguments "wasb:///example/data/gutenberg/davinci.txt", "wasb:///example/data/WordCountOutput"

	The hadoop-examples.jar file comes with the HDInsight cluster distribution. There are two arguments for the MapReduce job. The first one is the source file name, and the second is the output file path. The source file comes with the HDInsight cluster distribution, and the output file path will be created at the run-time.

6. Run the following command to submit the MapReduce job:

		# Submit the job
		Select-AzureSubscription $subscriptionName
		$wordCountJob = Start-AzureHDInsightJob -Cluster $clusterName -JobDefinition $wordCountJobDefinition 
		
	In addition to the MapReduce job definition, you must also provide the HDInsight cluster name where you want to run the MapReduce job. 

	The *Start-AzureHDInsightJob* is an asynchroized call.  To check the completion of the job, use the *Wait-AzureHDInsightJob* cmdlet.

6. Run the following command to check the completion of the MapReduce job:

		Wait-AzureHDInsightJob -Job $wordCountJob -WaitTimeoutInSeconds 3600 
		
8. Run the following command to check any errors with running the MapReduce job:	
	
		# Get the job output
		Get-AzureHDInsightJobOutput -Cluster $clusterName -JobId $wordCountJob.JobId -StandardError
		
	The following screenshot shows the output of a successful run. Otherwise, you will see some error messages.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.RunMRJob][image-hdi-gettingstarted-runmrjob]
































**To retrieve the results of the MapReduce job**

1. Open **Windows Azure PowerShell**.
2. Set the three variables in the following commands, and then run them:

		$subscriptionName = "<SubscriptionName>"       
		$storageAccountName = "<StorageAccountName>"   
		$containerName = "<ContainerName>"			   

	The Windows Azure Storage account is the one you created earlier in the tutorial. The storage account is used to host the Blob container that is used as the default HDInsight cluster file system.  The Blob storage container name usually share the same name as the HDInsight cluster unless you specify a different name when you provision the cluster.

3. Run the following commands to create a Windows Azure storage context object:
		
		# Create the storage account context object
		Select-AzureSubscription $subscriptionName
		$storageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey $storageAccountName | %{ $_.Primary }
		$storageContext = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey  

	The *Select-AzureSubscription* is used to set the current subscription in case you have multiple subscriptions, and the default subscription is not the one to use. 

4. Run the following command to download the MapReduce job output from the Blob container to the workstation:

		# Download the job output to the workstation
		Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Container $ContainerName -Blob example/data/WordCountOutput/part-r-00000 -Context $storageContext -Force

	The *example/data/WordCountOutput* folder is the output folder specified when you run the MapReduce job. *part-r-00000* is the default file name for MapReduce job output.  The file will be download to the same folder structure on the local folder. For example, in the following screenshot, the current folder is the C root folder. The file will be downloaded to the *C:\example\data\WordCountOutput&#92;* folder.

5. Run the following command to print the MapReduce job output file:

		cat ./example/data/WordCountOutput/part-r-00000 | findstr "there"

	![HDI.GettingStarted.MRJobOutput][image-hdi-gettingstarted-mrjoboutput]

	The MapReduce job produces a file named *part-r-00000* with the words and the counts.  The script uses the findstr command to list all of the words that contains *"there"*.


<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>If you open <i>./example/data/WordCountOutput/part-r-00000</i>, a multi-line output from a MapReduce job, in Notepad, you will notice the line breaks are not renter correctly. This is expected.</p> 
</div>


	
##<a name="powerquery"></a>Connecting to Microsoft business intelligence tools 

The Power Query add-in for Excel can be used to export output from HDInsight into Excel where Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) tools can be used to further process or display the results. When you created an HDInsight cluster, a default container with the same name as the cluster was created in the storage account associated with it when it was created. This is automatically populated with a set of files. One of these files is a sample Hive table. In this section we will show how to import the data contained in this table into Excel for viewing and additional processing.

You must have Excel 2010 or 2013 installed to complete this part of the tutorial. Here we will import the default Hive table that ships in HDInsight.

**To download Microsoft PowerQuery for Excel**

- Download Microsoft Power Query for Excel from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379) and install it.

**To import HDInsight data**

1. Open Excel, and create a new blank workbook.
3. Click the **Power Query** menu, click **From Other Sources**, and then click **From Windows Azure HDInsight**.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.PowerQuery.ImportData][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata]

3. Enter the **Account Name** of the Azure Blob Storage Account associated with your cluster, and then click **OK**. This is the storage account you created earlier in the tutorial.
4. Enter the **Account Key** for the Azure Blob Storage Account, and then click **Save**. 
5. In the Navigator pane, click the Blob storage container name. By default the container name is the same name as the cluster name. 

6. Locate **part-r-00000** in the **Name** column, and then click **Binary**.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.PowerQuery.ImportData2][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata2]

6. Right-click **Column1**, point to **Split Column**, and then click **By Delimiter**.
7. Select **Tab** in **Select or enter delimiter**, and **At the right-most delimiter**, and then click **OK**.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.PowerQuery.ImportData3][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata3]

8. Right-click **Column1.1**, and then select **Rename**.
9. Change the name to **Word**.
10. Repeat the process to rename **Column1.2** to **Count**.
9. Click **Done** on the bottom right corner. The query then imports the Hive Table into Excel.
