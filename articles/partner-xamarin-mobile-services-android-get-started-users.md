<p>This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Windows Azure Mobile Services from your Xamarin.Android app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.</p>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

Completing this tutorial requires [Xamarin.Android] and Android SDK 4.2 or a later version. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services</h2>

To be able to authenticate users, you must register your app with an identity provider. You must then register the provider-generated client secret with Mobile Services.

1. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

   	![][4]

2. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL** value.

   	![][5]

    You may need to provide this value to the identity provider when you register your app.

3. Choose a supported identity provider from the list below and follow the steps to register your app with that provider:

 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-microsoft-authentication/" target="_blank">Microsoft Account</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-facebook-authentication/" target="_blank">Facebook login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-twitter-authentication/" target="_blank">Twitter login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-google-authentication/" target="_blank">Google login</a>

    Remember to make a note of the client identity and secret values generated by the provider.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The provider-generated secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.</p>
    </div>

4. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Identity** tab, enter the app identifier and shared secret values obtained from your identity provider, and click **Save**.

   	![][13]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with your chosen authentication provider.

<h2><a name="permissions"></a><span class="short-header">Restrict permissions</span>Restrict permissions to authenticated users</h2>

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab, and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   	![][14]

2. Click the **Permissions** tab, set all permissions to **Only authenticated users**, and then click **Save**. This will ensure that all operations against the **TodoItem** table require an authenticated user. This also simplifies the scripts in the next tutorial because they will not have to allow for the possibility of anonymous users.

   	![][15]

3. In Eclipse, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

4. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run** to start the app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. 

	 This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

<h2><a name="add-authentication"></a><span class="short-header">Add authentication</span>Add authentication to the app</h2>

1. Add the following method to the **TodoActivity** class: 

	        private async Task Authenticate()
	        {
	            try
	            {
	                user = await client.LoginAsync(this, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.MicrosoftAccount);
	                CreateAndShowDialog(string.Format("you are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId), "Logged in!");
	            }
	            catch (Exception ex)
	            {
	                CreateAndShowDialog(ex, "Authentication failed");
	            }
	        }

    This creates a new method to handle the authentication process. The user is authenticated by using a Microsoft Account login. A dialog is displayed which displays the ID of the authenticated user. You cannot proceed without a positive authentication.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>If you are using an identity provider other than Microsoft, change the value passed to the <strong>login</strong> method above to one of the following: <i>Facebook</i>, <i>Google</i>, or <i>Twitter</i>.</p>
    </div>

2. In the **OnCreate** method, add the following line of code after the code that instantiates the `MobileServiceClient` object.

		await Authenticate();

	This call starts the authentication process and awaits it asynchronously.

3. Move the remaining code after `await Authenticate();` in the **OnCreate** method to a new **CreateTable** method, which looks like this:

	        private async Task CreateTable()
	        {
	            // Get the Mobile Service Table instance to use
	            todoTable = client.GetTable<TodoItem>();

	            textNewTodo = FindViewById<EditText>(Resource.Id.textNewTodo);

	            // Create an adapter to bind the items with the view
	            adapter = new TodoItemAdapter(this, Resource.Layout.Row_List_To_Do);
	            var listViewTodo = FindViewById<ListView>(Resource.Id.listViewTodo);
	            listViewTodo.Adapter = adapter;

	            // Load the items from the Mobile Service
	            await RefreshItemsFromTableAsync();
	        }

4. Then call the new **CreateTable** method in **OnCreate** after the **Authenticate** call added in step 2:

		await CreateTable();


5. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run** to start the app and sign in with your chosen identity provider. 

   	When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.

In the next tutorial, [Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
