# Release Notes for Logging Adapters for .NET

If you already use a logging framework such as log4net, NLog, or System.Diagnostics.Trace, you can capture those logs and send them to [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/), where you can correlate log traces with user actions, exceptions and other events.


#### To get started

See [Logs, exceptions and custom diagnostics for ASP.NET in Application Insights](app-insights-search-diagnostic-logs.md).

## Version 1.2.6

- Bug fixes
- log4Net: Collect log4net properties as custom properties. UserName is not a custom property any more (It is collected as telemetry.Context.User.Id). Timestamp is not a custom property any more.
- NLog: Collect NLog properties as custom properties. SequenceID is not a custom property any more (It is collected as telemetry.Sequence). Timestamp is not a custom property any more. 

## Version 1.2.5
- First open source version: References Application Insights API version 1.2.3 or higher.
