# Exploring Metrics in Application Insights

Metrics in [Application Insights][start] are measured values and counts of events that are sent in telemetry from your application. They help you detect performance issues and watch trends in how your application is being used. There's a wide range of standard metrics, and you can also create your own custom metrics and events.

Metrics and event counts are displayed in charts of aggregated values such as sums, averages, or counts.

Here's a sample chart:

![Open the overview blade of your application in the Azure portal](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/01-overview.png)

Some charts are segmented: the total height of the chart at any point is the sum of the metrics displayed. The legend by default shows the largest quantities.

Dotted lines show the value of the metric one week previously.



## Time range

You can change the Time range covered by the charts or grids on any blade.

![Open the overview blade of your application in the Azure portal](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/03-range.png)


If you're expecting some data that hasn't appeared yet, click Refresh. Charts refresh themselves at intervals, but the intervals are longer for larger time ranges. In release mode, it can take a while for data to come through the analysis pipeline onto a chart.

To zoom into part of a chart, drag over it and then click the magnifier symbol:

![Drag across part of a chart.](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/12-drag.png)



## Granularity and point values

Hover your mouse over the chart to display the values of the metrics at that point.

![Hover the mouse over a chart](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/02-focus.png)

The value of the metric at a particular point is aggregated over the preceding sampling interval. 

The sampling interval or "granularity" is shown at the top of the blade. 

![The header of a blade.](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/11-grain.png)

You can adjust the granularity in the Time range blade:

![The header of a blade.](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/grain.png)

The granularities available depend on the time range you select. The explicit granularities are alternatives to the "automatic" granularity for the time range. 

## Metrics Explorer

Click through any chart on the overview blade to see a more detailed set of related charts and grids. You can edit these charts and grids to focus on the details you're interested in.

Or you can just click the Metrics Explorer button in the head of the overview blade.

For example, click through the web app's Failed Requests chart:

![On the overview blade, click a chart](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/14-trix.png)


## What do the figures mean?

The legend at the side by default usually shows the aggregated value over the period of the chart. If you hover over the chart, it shows the value at that point.

Each data point on the chart is an aggregate of the data values received in the preceding sampling interval or "granularity". The granularity is shown at the top of the blade, and varies with the overall timescale of the chart.

Metrics can be aggregated in different ways: 

 * **Sum** adds up the values of all the data points received over the sampling interval, or the period of the chart.
 * **Average** divides the Sum by the number of data points received over the interval.
 * **Unique** counts are used for counts of users and accounts. Over the sampling interval, or over the period of the chart, the figure shows the count of different users seen in that time.


You can change the aggregation method:

![Select the chart and then select aggregation](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/05-aggregation.png)

The default method for each metric is shown when you create a new chart:

![Deselect all metrics to see the defaults](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/06-total.png)


## Editing charts and grids

To add a new chart to the blade:

![In Metrics Explorer, choose Add Chart](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/04-add.png)

Select an existing or new chart to edit what it shows:

![Select one or more metrics](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/08-select.png)

You can display more than one metric on a chart, though there are restrictions about the combinations that can be displayed together. As soon as you choose one metric, some of the others are disabled. 

If you coded [custom metrics][track] into your app (calls to TrackMetric and TrackEvent) they will be listed here.

## Segment your data

Select a chart or grid, switch on grouping and pick a property to group by:

![Select Grouping On, then set select a property in Group By](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/15-segment.png)

If you coded [custom metrics][track] into your app and they include property values, you'll be able to select the property in the list.

Is the chart too small for segmented data? Adjust its height:


![Adjust the slider](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/18-height.png)


## Filter your data

To see just the metrics for a selected set of property values:

![Click Filter, expand a property, and check some values](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/19-filter.png)

If you don't select any values for a particular property, it's the same as selecting them all: there is no filter on that property.

Notice the counts of events alongside each property value. When you select values of one property, the counts alongside other property values are adjusted.

### To add properties to the filter list

Would you like to filter telemetry on a category of your own choosing? For example, maybe you divide up your users into  different categories, and you would like segment your data by these categories.

[Create your own property](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#properties). Set it in a [Telemetry Initializer](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#telemetry-initializers) to have it appear in all telemetry - including the standard telemetry sent by different SDK modules.

## Remove bot and web test traffic

Use the filter **Real or synthetic traffic** and check **Real**.

You can also filter by **Source of synthetic traffic**.

## Edit the chart type

In particular, notice that you can switch between grids and graphs:

![Select a grid or graph, then choose a chart type](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/16-chart-grid.png)

## Save your metrics blade

When you've created some charts, save them as a favorite. You can choose whether to share it with other team members, if you use an organizational account.

![Choose Favorite](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/21-favorite-save.png)

To see the blade again, **go to the overview blade** and open Favorites:

![In the Overview blade, choose Favorites](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/22-favorite-get.png)

If you chose Relative time range when you saved, the blade will be updated with the latest metrics. If you chose Absolute time range, it will show the same data every time.

## Reset the blade

If you edit a blade but then you'd like to get back to the original saved set, just click Reset.

![In the buttons at the top of Metric Explorer](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/17-reset.png)

## Set alerts

To be notified by email of unusual values of any metric, add an alert. You can choose either to send the email to the account administrators, or to specific email addresses.

![In Metrics Explorer, choose Alert rules, Add Alert](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/appinsights-413setMetricAlert.png)

[Learn more about alerts][alerts].

## Export to Excel

You can export metric data that is displayed in Metric Explorer to an Excel file. The exported data includes data from all charts and tables as seen in the portal. 


![In Metrics Explorer, choose Alert rules, Add Alert](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/31-export.png)

The data for each chart or table is exported to a separate sheet in the Excel file.

What you see is what gets exported. Change the time range or filters if you want to change the range of data exported. For tables, if the **load more** command is showing, you can click it before you click Export, to have more data exported.

*Export works only for Internet Explorer and Chrome at present. We're working on adding support for other browsers.*

### Continuous Export

If you want data continuously exported so that you can process it externally, consider using [Continous export](app-insights-export-telemetry.md).

### Power BI

If you want even richer views of your data, you can [export to Power BI](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2015/11/04/explore-your-application-insights-data-with-power-bi.aspx).
