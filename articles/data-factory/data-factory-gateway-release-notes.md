# Release notes for Data Management Gateway

One of the challenges for modern data integration is to seamlessly move data to and from on-premises to cloud. Data factory makes this integration seamless with Data Management Gateway, which is an agent that you can install on-premises to enable hybrid data movement.

Please refer to [Move data between on-premises and cloud using Azure Data Factory](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) for more information.

## Questions/answers

### Why is the Data Source Manager trying to connect to a gateway?
This is a security design where you can only configure on-premises data sources for cloud access within your corporate network, and your credentials will not flow outside of your corporate firewall. Ensure your computer can reach the machine where the gateway is installed.
