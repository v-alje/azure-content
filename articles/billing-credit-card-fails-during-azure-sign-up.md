# My credit card doesnâ€™t go through when I try to sign up for Azure
This article discusses common causes of sign-up issues using a credit or debit card.

## Are any other options to pay besides a credit or debit card?
Azure payment options include:

- Credit or debit card (except for virtual and prepaid cards)
- Invoice. Once you opt for the invoice option, you can't move to the credit card option for the same Azure subscription. If you are a company and you are interested to learn about alternate payment method being invoiced, please read [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/). Invoicing payment methods include check, overnight check, and wire transfers.

##  Are you using a supported credit card for Azure activations or payments?
- Currently only credit/debit card that are not virtual and not prepaid are accepted.
- Accepted credit/debit card providers vary based on your country.

Suggestions:
- Do not use a virtual or prepaid debit/credit card.
- Try to use an alternate valid and supported credit card if payment or activation fails.
- Be sure that the payment method is active and that your bank is not blocking any online transaction for security policies.

## Is the credit card information correct and complete?
- Credit card details must be correct and match the credit card bank billing information.
- The name being entered must exactly match the name imprinted on the credit card without any symbols/characters.
- The address entered is the one the bill is sent to and is entered exactly as it appears on the credit card statement including street address, city, state, and zip/postal code.
- The CVV code is inserted as it appears on the back or front of the credit card.
- Work with your bank to correct any spelling or other issues with information on your card.

Suggestions:
- Always provide accurate information on sign-up, as profile details are also used to generate billing statements.

## Is your account profile information correct and complete?
- The account owner must insert all the relevant information requested during sign-up in order to identify the person owning the account and to be able to generate correct billing statements when needed.
- Examples of incorrect or incomplete fields are: missing name or surname, wrong phone number, non-standard (special) characters.

Suggestions:
- Double check each field in your profile at sign-up or at [your profile setting]( https://account.windowsazure.com/Profile/) if you already created an Azure account.
- Provide accurate information, as profile details are also used to generate billing statements.

## Are you trying to activate an Azure benefit plan like MSDN, BizSpark, or MPN?  
Verify through your benefit program channel if you are eligible for the chosen plan:
- MSDN:
  - Verify your eligibility status in your [MSDN account page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/default.aspx).
  - If you cannot verify your status, contact the [MSDN Subscriptions Customer Service Centers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/contactus.aspx)
- MPN
  - Sign in to the [MPN portal](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Locale.aspx) and verify your eligibility status. You may be eligible for additional benefits if you have the appropriate [Cloud Platform Competencies](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/membership/cloud-platform-competency.aspx).
  - If you cannot verify your status, contact [MPN support](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Support/Premium/contact-support.aspx).
- Bizpark:
  - Sign in to the [BizSpark portal](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/default.aspx#start-two) and verify your eligibility status for BizSpark and BizSpark Plus.
  If you cannot verify your status, contact BizSpark Support sending an email to [Contact BizSpark Team](mailto:bizspark@microsoft.com?subject=BizSpark%20Support&body=Thank%20you%20for%20contacting%20BizSpark.%20Please%20provide%20as%20much%20of%20the%20following%20information%20as%20possible,%20as%20it%20will%20help%20expedite%20our%20response%20to%20you.%0aContact%20name:%0aStartup%20name:%0aMicrosoft%20Account/Live%20ID:%0aSpecific%20description%20of%20issue%20experienced%20or%20question:%0a%0aThank%20you,%0a%0aThe%20BizSpark%20Team)

Suggestions:

If you get an error signing up for a new benefit subscription, you can go to the [Azure subscription page]( http://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) to see if the subscription was created. Some types of subscriptions may show as pending, and will become active in a few minutes. If the status does not change after a few minutes you can contact [Azure Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=544831&clcid=0x409) for assistance at no charge.

## Have you already used an Azure subscription in the past and now you are trying to activate an Azure Free Trial?
The Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one free trial activation.

Suggestions:

If a free trial activation fails because you already activated an Azure subscription in the past, please use another available Azure plan listed in the [Microsoft Azure offer details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) instead of the Azure Free Trial plan.

## Contact Azure Support
