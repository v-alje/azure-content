# How to sign up for, purchase, upgrade or activate an Azure subscription

## Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription

To sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription, you must provide a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft Account. Your Microsoft account is the email address you use, along with your password, to sign in to any Windows Live program or service, such as Outlook, Hotmail, or OneDrive. You may set up a Microsoft account using any email address belonging to you, including your company email. Please see [Microsoft account FAQ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/faq.aspx) for more details.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Your phone number and credit card details are used only to verify your identity. Although your credit card won’t be charged, Microsoft will place an authorization hold on it for a minimal amount to verify that the credit card is valid. The hold will be released within 3-5 business days, depending on your financial institution’s policies.

1. Open the [Azure free trial page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/), and then select **Try it now**.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account or School/Work account.
3. In the **About you** section, enter your personal information.  
![The screenshot of personal information](./media/billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription/AboutYou.png)

 **Note** The email address and Country information that you provide when you sign up for an Azure subscription will always be associated with the subscription, and cannot be changed at a later time.</br>
4. In the **Verification by phone** section, you must provide a phone number to receive a verification code that you can provide to complete the verification process.

 You can choose to receive the verification code either as a text message or through a voice call. Make your choice by selecting either **Send text message** or **Call me**. Select the international dialing code for your country in the first box, and enter your phone number in the second box. After you receive the verification code, enter it in the third box, and then select the **Verify code** button.

 **Note** You cannot use a VOIP phone number for the phone verification process.</br>
 ![the screenshot about phone verification](./media/billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription/PhoneVerify.png)</br>If you don't receive a text message or a call, try using a different phone number or contact [Azure Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=544831&clcid=0x409) for help. </br>
5. In the **Verification by card** section, enter the details of a valid credit card. This information is collected only to verify your identity.

 **Note** Although your credit card won’t be charged, Microsoft will place an authorization hold on it for a minimal amount to verify that the credit card is valid. The hold will be released within 3-5 business days, depending on your financial institution’s policies.

 If you receive an error after submitting your credit card information, see the article [My credit card doesn’t go through when I try to sign up for Azure](../billing-credit-card-fails-during-azure-sign-up.md).

The example screenshot is for the English version of the agreement. The agreement form may vary by country.

 It can take a few minutes to set up your subscription. If the subscription setup does not complete in 15 minutes contact [Azure Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for assistance. </br>
 If you get an error message, follow the steps in the message to resolve the issue. A typical error message is:

 **Sorry, we could not complete the operation. Please try again later or reload the web page** </br>

 In this case, try using another browser to complete the sign-up process. If the issue still occurs, contact [Azure Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for help.</br>
7. When the subscription is ready, select **Start managing my service** to begin.</br>

## Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) by using the Microsoft account or your School/Work account that you used to sign up for the free trail.
2. Select the subscription, and then select **Upgrade**.</br>![billpage](./media/billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription/billpage.png)
3. Select **Yes**, and then select **Upgrade now**. </br>![upgrade](./media/billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription/Upgrade.png)

When you upgrade from a free trial subscription to a pay-as-you-go subscription, any benefits left over from your free trial such as the 30 day limit or the $200 credit to use on Azure services will continue until one of them is exhausted. The subscription upgrade will happen only after that.

## Activate your Azure subscription by using an Online Service Activation Key (a 5x5 key)

If you bought Azure in Open credits from a reseller, follow these steps to activate your subscription:

1. Go to the [subscription summary page](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) on azure.com.

2. Select **Azure in Open**. In the [Azure in Open License key](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0111p/) page, select **Activate a new subscription or existing subscription**.

3. Enter the product key, and then check the agreement option.
