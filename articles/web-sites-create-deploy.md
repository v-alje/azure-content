##<a name="createawebsiteportal"></a>How to: Create a Web Site Using the Management Portal

Follow these steps to create a web site in Windows Azure.
	
1. Login to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).

2. Click the **Create New** icon on the bottom left of the Management Portal.

3. Click the **Web Site** icon, click the **Quick Create** icon, enter a value for URL and then click the check mark next to **Create Web Site** on the bottom right corner of the page.

4. When the web site has been created, you will see the text **Creating web site <*web site name*>  succeeded**. You can browse to the web site by clicking **Browse** at the bottom of the portal page.

5. In the portal, click the name of the web site displayed in the list of web sites to open the web site's **Quick Start** management page.

6. On the **Quick Start** page, you are provided with options to get web site development tools, set up publishing for your web site, or set up deployment from a source control provider like TFS or Git. FTP publishing is set up by default for web sites and the FTP Host name is displayed in the **Quick Glance** section of the **Dashboard** page under **FTP Host Name**. Before publishing with FTP or Git, choose the option to **Reset deployment credentials** on the **Dashboard** page so that you can authenticate against the FTP Host or the Git Repository when deploying content to your web site.

7. The **Configure** management page exposes settings for your web site in the following categories:

 - **General**: Set the version of .NET framework or PHP required by your web application. For sites in Standard mode, the **Platform** option lets you choose either a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.

- **Certificates**: In Standard mode, you can upload SSL certificates for custom domains. 

- **Domain Names**: In Shared and Standard modes, you can view and manage custom domain names for your web site.

- **SSL Bindings**: In Standard mode, you can assign SSL certificates to your custom domain names using either IP-based or SNI-based SSL.

 - **Deployments**: When you set up deployment from source control, you can configure your deployments here.

 - **Application Diagnostics**:  Set options for gathering diagnostic traces from a web application that has been instrumented with traces. 

- **Site Diagnostics**: Set logging options for gathering diagnostic information for your web site. Options include Web Server Logging, Detailed Error Messages, and Failed Request Tracing.

- **Monitoring**: For web sites in Standard mode, you can use this feature to test the availability of HTTP or HTTPS endpoints. 

- **App Settings**: Specify name/value pairs that will be loaded by your web application on start up. For .NET sites, these settings will be injected into your .NET configuration **AppSettings** at runtime, overriding existing settings. For PHP and Node sites these settings will be available as environment variables at runtime.

 - **Connection Strings**: View and edit connection strings. For .NET sites, these connection strings will be injected into your .NET configuration **connectionStrings** settings at runtime, overriding existing entries where the key equals the linked database name. For PHP and Node sites, these settings will be available as environment variables at runtime.

 - **Default Documents**: A web site's default document is the page that is displayed by default when a user navigates to a web site. Add your web application's default document to this list if it is not already present.  Your web site's default document should be at the top of the list.

- **Handler Mappings**: Specify script processors that will handle requests for specific file extensions like *.php.
