#How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Windows Server#

For a virtual machine that is running the Windows Server operating system, you use the Connect button in the Management Portal to start a Remote Desktop Connection. 

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com).

2. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the appropriate virtual machine.

3. On the command bar, click **Connect**.

5. Click **Connect** to proceed with the connection process.

6. Type the user name and password of the administrative account on the virtual machine, and then click **OK**.
	
	
7. Click **Yes** to verify the identity of the virtual machine.
