<h2><a id="SignUp"></a>Step 1: Sign-Up for the Preview of Premium for SQL Database</h2>

	**Note** - Only Windows Azure account administrators can access the Account portal.

	![Image3](./media/sql-database-premium-sign-up/Subscription-Figure3.png)

	Only active, paid Windows Azure subscriptions are eligible for the preview. You may sign up multiple subscriptions, but each subscription can be signed up only once. 

	Signing a subscription up for the preview will not incur additional charges, but once activated and Premium quota granted, creating or upgrading to a Premium database is subject to the pricing outlined in the [SQL Database Pricing Page](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/).

	The current status of the sign up request is reflected in the preview features list.

	![Image4](./media/sql-database-premium-sign-up/Status-Figure4.png)

4. Requests will be approved based on current capacity and demand. You may wait up to 2 days for your subscription to be activated, with longer wait times indicating high demand or fulfilled public preview capacity.

5. You will receive an email notification once your subscription is activated for the preview. 


<h2><a id="Quota"></a>Step 2: Request Premium database quota</h2>
Once your subscription is activated for the preview, you need to request Premium database quota for each server on which you plan to create a Premium database. As capacity is limited, please only request quota for servers on which you plan to create a Premium database, and cancel any unneeded pending requests.


1.	Sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) using your Microsoft account.

	**Note** - Account administrators, service administrators, and co-administrators of the subscription can request quota once the subscription is signed up for the preview.

2.	Navigate to the **Servers** list in the **SQL Databases** extension.
3.	Select the server for which you plan to request Premium database quota.
4.	Navigate to the **Quick Start** for the selected server by clicking the lightning bolt icon in the top navigation bar.
5.	Click **Request Premium Database Quota** in the **Premium Database** section.

	![Image6](./media/sql-database-premium-sign-up/RequestQuota-Figure6.png)


	Once your request is submitted, you may wait up to 5 days before being granted quota. Longer wait times may indicate high demand or fulfilled preview capacity.
	
	A few additional notes about Premium database quota requests:
	
	- Quota is not available to customers with free-trial subscriptions.
	- Quota is limited initially, and requests will be granted based on current demand and available capacity.
	- Microsoft may reclaim unused quota after 15 days.
	- Only one quota request can be submitted for each logical server in the subscription.
	- Initially, quota is limited to one database per logical server.
	- Requesting database quota is free, however, creating a Premium edition database or upgrading an existing Web or Business edition database to Premium will increase the cost of the database.
6.	You can see the status of your quota request on the server's **Quick Start** page.

8.	Once granted, you can see a server's remaining Premium database quota on the server's **Quick Start** or **Dashboard** tab.
