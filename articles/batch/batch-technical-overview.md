# Basics of Azure Batch

Azure Batch helps you run large-scale parallel and high performance computing (HPC) applications efficiently in the cloud. It's a platform service that schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed collection of virtual machines (compute nodes) and can scale the compute resources to meet the needs of the job. With the Batch service, you programmatically define Azure compute resources and large-scale batch jobs that run on demand or on a schedule, and you don't need to manually configure and manage an HPC cluster, individual VMs, virtual networks, or a job scheduler.

## Use cases

Batch is a managed service for *batch processing* or *batch computing* - running a large volume of similar tasks to get some desired result. Batch computing is a common pattern for organizations that process, transform, and analyze large amounts of data, either on a schedule or on-demand, with examples in fields ranging from financial services to engineering.

Batch works well with intrinsically parallel (sometimes called "embarrassingly parallel") applications or workloads, which lend themselves to running as parallel tasks on multiple computers. See Figure 1.

![Parallel tasks][parallel]

**Figure 1. Parallel tasks running on multiple computers**

Examples include:

* Financial risk modeling
* Image rendering and image processing
* Media encoding and transcoding
* Genetic sequence analysis
* Software testing

Batch can also perform parallel calculations with a reduce step at the end, and more complex HPC workloads such as message passing interface (MPI) applications.

>[AZURE.NOTE]At this time Batch only supports workloads that run on Windows Server-based virtual machines. 

For a comparison of Batch with other HPC solution options in Azure, see [Batch and HPC solutions](batch-hpc-solutions.md).

## Developing with Batch

Develop with the Batch APIs to create and manage pools of compute nodes and to schedule the jobs and tasks that run on them. Write client applications or front-ends to run jobs and tasks on demand, on a schedule, or as part of a larger workflow managed by tools such as [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/data-factory/).

See [Azure Batch feature overview](batch-api-basics.md) for more about the Batch concepts.

### Accounts you'll need

+ **Azure account and subscription** - If you don't have an account, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

+ **Batch account** - You use the name and URL of a Batch account and an access key as credentials when you make Batch API calls. All your Batch resources such as compute nodes, pools, jobs, and tasks are associated with a Batch account. One way to create a Batch account and manage access keys for the account is to use the [Azure portal](batch-account-create-portal.md).

+ **Storage account** - For most Batch scenarios you'll need an Azure storage account to store your data inputs and outputs and the scripts or executables that run on the compute nodes. To create a storage account, see [About Azure storage accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md).

### Batch development libraries and tools

Use these .NET libraries and tools with Visual Studio to develop and manage Azure Batch applications.

+ [Batch client .NET library](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Batch/) (NuGet) – Develop client applications to run jobs with the Batch service
+ [Batch Management .NET library](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Batch/) (NuGet) – Manage Batch accounts
+ [Batch Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples/tree/master/CSharp/BatchExplorer) (GitHub) - Build this GUI application to browse, access, and update resources in a Batch account, including jobs and tasks, compute nodes and pools, and files on a compute node. See the [blog post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowshpc/archive/2015/01/20/azure-batch-explorer-sample-walkthrough.aspx).


## Scenario: Scale out a parallel workload

A common scenario with the Batch APIs involves scaling out intrinsically parallel work such as image rendering on a pool of compute nodes providing up to thousands of compute cores.

Figure 2 shows a workflow that uses a Batch .NET client application to run a parallel workload with Batch.


![Workitems workflow][work_item_workflow]

**Figure 2. Scale out a parallel workload on Batch**

1.	Upload input files (such as source data or images) required for a job to an Azure storage account. The Batch service will load files onto compute nodes when the job tasks run.

2.	Upload the program files or scripts that will run on the compute nodes to the storage account. These might include binary files and their dependent assemblies. The Batch service will also load these files onto the compute nodes when the tasks run.

3.	Programmatically create a pool of Batch compute nodes in your Batch account, specifying properties such as their size and the OS they run. You can also define how the number of nodes in the pool [scales up or down](batch-automatic-scaling.md) in response to the workload. When a task runs, it's assigned a node from this pool.

4.	Programmatically define a Batch job to run the workload on the pool of nodes.

5.	Add tasks to the job. Each task uses the program that you uploaded to process information from a file you uploaded. Depending on your workload, you might want to run [multiple tasks at the same time](batch-parallel-node-tasks.md) on each compute node to maximize resource usage. Batch also supports specialized [job preparation and completion tasks](batch-job-prep-release.md) to prepare the compute nodes before the scheduled tasks run and to clean up afterward.

6.	Run the Batch workload and monitor the progress and results. The application communicates over HTTPS with the Batch service. To improve application performance when monitoring large numbers of pools, jobs, and tasks, take advantage of [efficient techniques to query](batch-efficient-list-queries.md) the Batch service.
