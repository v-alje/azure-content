# Run job preparation and completion tasks on Azure Batch compute nodes

Azure Batch jobs often require some form of setup prior to execution, and similarly, some sort of post-job maintenance after the job's tasks are completed. Batch provides the mechanisms for this preparation and maintenance in the form of optional *job preparation* and *job release* tasks.

Before any of a job's tasks run, the job preparation task runs on all compute nodes that are scheduled to run tasks. Once the job is completed, the job release task runs on each node in the pool that executed at least one task. For both job preparation and release tasks, you can specify a command line to invoke when the task is run. These special tasks offer familiar task features such as file download, elevated execution, custom environment variables, maximum execution duration, retry count, and file retention time.

In the following sections, you'll find out how to use these two special task types by using the [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep] class and [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] class in the [Batch .NET][api_net] API.

> [AZURE.TIP] Job preparation and release tasks are especially helpful in "shared pool" environments--those environments in which a pool of compute nodes persists between job runs, and is shared between many different jobs.

## When to use job preparation and release tasks

A number of situations benefit from job preparation and release tasks. Here are just a few:

**Transfer of common task data**

Batch jobs often require a common set of data as input for the job's tasks. For example, in daily risk analysis calculations, market data is job specific, yet common to all of the tasks in the job. This market data, often several gigabytes in size, should be downloaded to each compute node only once so that any task that runs on a node can use it. Use a *job preparation task* to download the data to each node before the execution of the job's other tasks.

**Job data deletion**

Within a shared pool environment in which a pool's compute nodes are not decommissioned between jobs, deleting job data between runs might be needed--to conserve disk space on the nodes or to satisfy an organization's security policies. Use a *job release task* to delete data that was downloaded by a job preparation task or generated during task execution.

**Log retention**

You might want to keep a copy of log files that your tasks generate, or perhaps crash dump files that can be generated by failed applications. Use a *job release task* in such cases to compress and upload this data to an [Azure Storage][azure_storage] account.

## Job preparation task

Prior to the execution of a job's tasks, the job preparation task is executed on each compute node that is scheduled to run a task. By default, the Batch service will wait for the job preparation task to be completed before running the tasks scheduled to execute on the node. However, you can configure the service not to wait. The job preparation task will run again on a compute node if the node restarts, but you can also disable this behavior.

The job preparation task is only executed on nodes that are scheduled to run a task. This prevents the unnecessary execution of a preparation task in case a node is not assigned a task. This can occur when the number of tasks for a job is less than the number of nodes in a pool. It also applies when [concurrent task execution](batch-parallel-node-tasks.md) is enabled, which leaves some nodes idle if the task count is lower than the total possible concurrent tasks. By not running the job preparation task on idle nodes, you can spend less money on data transfer charges.

> [AZURE.NOTE] [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] differs from [CloudPool.StartTask][pool_starttask] in that JobPreparationTask executes at the start of each job, whereas StartTask executes only when a compute node first joins a pool or restarts.

## Job release task

Once a job is marked as completed, the job release task is executed on each node in the pool that executed at least one task. You mark a job as completed by issuing a terminate request. The Batch service then sets the job state to *terminating*, terminates any active or running tasks associated with the job, and runs the job release task. The job then moves to the *completed* state.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Job deletion also executes the job release task. However, if a job has already been terminated, the release task is not run a second time if that job is subsequently deleted.

## Job preparation and release tasks in the Batch .NET API

To specify a job preparation task, you create and configure a [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep] object and assign it to your job's [CloudJob.JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property. Similarly, initialize [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] and assign it to your job's [CloudJob.JobReleaseTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property to set the job's release task.

In this code snippet, `myBatchClient` is a fully initialized instance of [BatchClient][net_batch_client], and `myPool` is an existing pool within the Batch account.

		// Create the CloudJob for CloudPool "myPool"
		CloudJob myJob = myBatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob("JobPrepReleaseSampleJob",
															   new PoolInformation() { PoolId = "myPool" });

		// Specify the command lines for the job preparation and release tasks
		string jobPrepCmdLine = "cmd /c echo %AZ_BATCH_NODE_ID% > %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\shared_file.txt";
		string jobReleaseCmdLine = "cmd /c del %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\shared_file.txt";

		// Assign the job preparation task to the job
		myJob.JobPreparationTask = new JobPreparationTask { CommandLine = jobPrepCmdLine };

		// Assign the job release task to the job
		myJob.JobReleaseTask = new JobPreparationTask { CommandLine = jobReleaseCmdLine };

		await myJob.CommitAsync();

As mentioned above, the release task is executed when a job is terminated or deleted. Terminating a job with the Batch .NET API is performed by calling [PoolOperations.TerminateJobAsync][net_job_terminate]. Job deletion is performed with [PoolOperations.DeleteJobAsync][net_job_delete]. Both of these actions are typically done when a job's tasks are completed or when a timeout that you've defined has been reached.

		// Terminate the job to mark it as Completed; this will initiate the Job Release Task on any node
		// that executed job tasks. Note that the Job Release Task is also executed when a job is deleted,
		// thus you need not call Terminate if you typically delete your jobs upon task completion.
		await myBatchClient.JobOperations.TerminateJobAsync("JobPrepReleaseSampleJob");

### Sample project on GitHub

Check out the [JobPrepRelease][job_prep_release_sample] sample project on GitHub to see job preparation and release tasks in action. This console application does the following:

1. Creates a pool with two "small" nodes.
2. Creates a job with job preparation, release, and standard tasks.
3. Runs the job preparation task, which first writes the node ID to a text file in a node's "shared" directory.
4. Runs a task on each node that writes its task ID to the same text file.
5. Once all tasks are completed (or the timeout is reached), prints the contents of each node's text file to the console.
6. When the job is completed, runs the job release task to delete the file from the node.
6. Prints the exit codes of the job preparation and release tasks for each node on which they executed.
7. Pauses execution to allow confirmation of job and/or pool deletion.

Output from the sample application is similar to the following:

```
Attempting to create pool: JobPrepReleaseSamplePool
The pool already existed when we tried to create it
Checking for existing job JobPrepReleaseSampleJob...
Job JobPrepReleaseSampleJob not found, creating...
Submitting tasks and awaiting completion...
All tasks completed.

### Inspect job preparation and release tasks with Batch Explorer

The [Azure Batch Explorer][batch_explorer_article], which is also found in the Batch [sample code repository][batch_explorer_project] on GitHub, is an excellent tool to use when you're developing solutions with Azure Batch. For example, when you're running the above sample application, you can use Batch Explorer to view the properties of the job and its tasks, or even download the shared text file that is modified by the job's tasks.

The screenshot below highlights the job preparation and release task properties that are shown in the **Job Details** pane when you select the *JobPrepReleaseSampleJob* job on the **Jobs** tab.
