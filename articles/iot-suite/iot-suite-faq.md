# Frequently asked questions

### How many DocumentDB instances can I provision in a subscription?

Five. You can create a support ticket to raise this limit, but by default, you can only provision five DocumentDB instances per subscription. As a result, you can only provision up to five remote monitoring preconfigured solutions in a given subscription.

### How many Free Bing Maps APIs can I provision in a subscription?

Two. You can create only two Free Bing Maps APIs in a subscription. The remote monitoring solution is provisioned by default with a Free Bing Maps API. As a result, you can only provision up to two remote monitoring solutions in a subscription with no modifications.

### What's the difference between deleting a resource group in the Azure portal and clicking delete on a preconfigured solution in azureiotsuite.com?

- If you delete the preconfigured solution in [azureiotsuite.com][lnk-azureiotsuite], you delete all the resources that were provisioned when you created the preconfigured solution; if you added additional resources to the resource group, these are also deleted. 

- If you delete the resource group in the [Azure portal][lnk-azure-portal], you only delete the resources in that resource group; you will also need to delete the Azure Active Directory application associated with the preconfigured solution in the [Azure classic portal][lnk-classic-portal].
