## Create a device identity

In this section, you'll create a Node.js console app that creates a new device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the device identity registry. Refer to the **Device Identity Registry** section of the [IoT Hub Developer Guide][lnk-devguide-identity] for more information. When you run this console application, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can identify itself with when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

1. Create a new empty folder called **createdeviceidentity**. In the **createdeviceidentity** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command-prompt. Accept all the defaults:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command-prompt in the **createdeviceidentity** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub** package:

    ```
    npm install azure-iothub --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file in the **createdeviceidentity** folder.

4. Add the following `require` statement at the start of the **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file:

    ```
    'use strict';
    
    var iothub = require('azure-iothub');
    ```

5. Add the following code to the **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file, replacing the placeholder value with the connection string for the IoT hub you created in the previous section: 

    ```
    var connectionString = '{iothub connection string}';
    
    var registry = iothub.Registry.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    ```

6. Add the following code to create a new device definition in the device identity registry in your IoT hub. This code creates a new device if the device id does not exist in the registry, otherwise it returns the key of the existing device:

    ```
    var device = new iothub.Device(null);
    device.deviceId = 'myFirstDevice';
    registry.create(device, function(err, deviceInfo, res) {
      if (err) {
        registry.get(device.deviceId, printDeviceInfo);
      }
      if (deviceInfo) {
        printDeviceInfo(err, deviceInfo, res)
      }
    });

    function printDeviceInfo(err, deviceInfo, res) {
      if (deviceInfo) {
        console.log('Device id: ' + deviceInfo.deviceId);
        console.log('Device key: ' + deviceInfo.authentication.SymmetricKey.primaryKey);
      }
    }
    ```

7. Save and close **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file.

8. To run the **createdeviceidentity** application, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the createdeviceidentity folder:

    ```
    node CreateDeviceIdentity.js 
    ```

9. Make a note of the **Device id** and **Device key**. You will need these later when you create an application that connects to IoT Hub as a device.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the hub. It stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials and an enabled/disabled flag that enables you to disable access for an individual device. If you application needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an application-specific store. Refer to [IoT Hub Developer Guide][lnk-devguide-identity] for more information.

## Receive device-to-cloud messages

In this section, you'll create a Node.js console app that reads device-to-cloud messages from IoT Hub. An IoT hub exposes an [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs-overview]-compatible endpoint to enable you to read device-to-cloud messages. To keep things simple, this tutorial creates a basic reader that is not suitable for a high throughput deployment. The [Process device-to-cloud messages][lnk-processd2c-tutorial] tutorial shows you how to process device-to-cloud messages at scale. The [Get Started with Event Hubs][lnk-eventhubs-tutorial] tutorial provides further information on how to process messages from Event Hubs and is applicable to the IoT Hub Event Hub-compatible endpoints.

1. Create a new empty folder called **readdevicetocloudmessages**. In the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command-prompt. Accept all the defaults:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command-prompt in the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder, run the following command to install the **amqp10** and **bluebird** packages:

    ```
    npm install amqp10 bluebird --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file in the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder.

4. Add the following `require` statements at the start of the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file:

    ```
    'use strict';

    var AMQPClient = require('amqp10').Client;
    var Policy = require('amqp10').Policy;
    var translator = require('amqp10').translator;
    var Promise = require('bluebird');
    ```

5. Add the following variable declarations, replacing the placeholders with the values you noted previously. The value of the **{your event hub-compatible namespace}** placeholder comes from the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** - it takes the form **xxxxnamespace.servicebus.windows.net**.

    ```
    var protocol = 'amqps';
    var eventHubHost = '{your event hub-compatible namespace}';
    var sasName = 'iothubowner';
    var sasKey = '{your iot hub key}';
    var eventHubName = '{your event hub-compatible name}';
    var numPartitions = 2;
    ```

    > [AZURE.NOTE] This code assumes you created your IoT hub in the F1 (free) tier. A free IoT hub has two partitions named "0" and "1". If you created your IoT hub using one of the other pricing tiers, you should adjust the code to create a **MessageReceiver** for each partition.

6. Add the following filter definition. This application uses a filter when it creates a receiver so that the receiver only reads messages sent to IoT Hub after the receiver starts running. This is useful in a test environment so you can see the current set of messages, but in a production environment your code should make sure that it processes all the messages - see the [How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages][lnk-processd2c-tutorial] tutorial for more information.

    ```
    var filterOffset = new Date().getTime();
    var filterOption;
    if (filterOffset) {
      filterOption = {
      attach: { source: { filter: {
      'apache.org:selector-filter:string': translator(
        ['described', ['symbol', 'apache.org:selector-filter:string'], ['string', "amqp.annotation.x-opt-enqueuedtimeutc > " + filterOffset + ""]])
        } } }
      };
    }
    ```

7. Add the following code to create the receive address and an AMQP client:

    ```
    var uri = protocol + '://' + encodeURIComponent(sasName) + ':' + encodeURIComponent(sasKey) + '@' + eventHubHost;
    var recvAddr = eventHubName + '/ConsumerGroups/$default/Partitions/';
    
    var client = new AMQPClient(Policy.EventHub);
    ```

8. Add the following two functions that print output to the console:

    ```
    var messageHandler = function (partitionId, message) {
      console.log('Received(' + partitionId + '): ', message.body);
    };
    
    var errorHandler = function(partitionId, err) {
      console.warn('** Receive error: ', err);
    };
    ```

9. Add the following function that acts as a receiver for a given partition using the filter:

    ```
    var createPartitionReceiver = function(partitionId, receiveAddress, filterOption) {
      return client.createReceiver(receiveAddress, filterOption)
        .then(function (receiver) {
          console.log('Listening on partition: ' + partitionId);
          receiver.on('message', messageHandler.bind(null, partitionId));
          receiver.on('errorReceived', errorHandler.bind(null, partitionId));
        });
    };
    ```

10. Add the following code to connect to the Event Hub-compatible endpoint and start the receivers:

    ```
    client.connect(uri)
      .then(function () {
        var partitions = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < numPartitions; ++i) {
          partitions.push(createPartitionReceiver(i, recvAddr + i, filterOption));
        }
        return Promise.all(partitions);
    })
    .error(function (e) {
        console.warn('Connection error: ', e);
    });
    ```

11. Save and close the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file.
