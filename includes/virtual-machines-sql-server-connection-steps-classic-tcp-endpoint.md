### Create a TCP endpoint for the virtual machine

In order to access SQL Server from the internet, the virtual machine must have an endpoint to listen for incoming TCP communication. This Azure configuration step, directs incoming TCP port traffic to a TCP port that is accessible to the virtual machine.

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you are connecting within the same cloud service or virtual network, you do not have to create a publically accessible endpoint. In that case, you could continue to the next step. For more information, see [Connection Scenarios](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-sql-server-connectivity.md#connection-scenarios).

1. On the Azure Management Portal, click on **VIRTUAL MACHINES**.
	
2. Click on your newly created virtual machine. Information about your virtual machine is presented.
	
3. Near the top of the page, select the **ENDPOINTS** page, and then at the bottom of the page, click **ADD**.
	
4. On the **Add an Endpoint to a Virtual Machine** page, click **Add a Stand-alone Endpoint**, and then click the Next arrow to continue.
	
5. On the **Specify the details of the endpoint** page, provide the following information.

	- In the **NAME** box, provide a name for the endpoint.
	- In the **PROTOCOL** box, select **TCP**. You may type **57500** in the **PUBLIC PORT** box. Similarly, you may type SQL Server's default listening port **1433** in the **Private Port** box. Note that many organizations select different port numbers to avoid malicious security attacks. 

6. Click the check mark to continue. The endpoint is created.
