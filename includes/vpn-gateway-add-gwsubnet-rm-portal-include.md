To create a gateway subnet in the Azure portal, do the following:

1. In the portal, navigate to the virtual network to which you want to connect a gateway. Click the name of the virtual network to expand the **Virtual network settings** blade.
2. On the **Settings** blade, click **Subnets** to expand the settings.
3. On the **Subnets** blade, click Add to expand the **Add subnet** blade.
4. On the **Add subnet** blade, name your subnet **GatewaySubnet**. You should not name it anything else, or the gateway will not work.
5. Add the IP **address range** for your gateway. Please verify the gateway subnet setting is correct for your configuration.
6. Click **OK** to create the subnet.
