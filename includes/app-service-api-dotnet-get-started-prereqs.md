### ASP.NET Web API

The tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to work with ASP.NET [Web API 2](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api) and [MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) in Visual Studio.

### Visual Studio 2015

The instructions and screen shots assume you're using Visual Studio 2015, but the same guidance works for Visual Studio 2013.

### Azure account

You do not need any prior knowledge of how to work with Microsoft Azure, but you do need an Azure account to complete the tutorial. You can:

* [Open an Azure account for free](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). You get credits that can be used to try out paid Azure services. Even after the credits are used up, you can keep the account and use free Azure services and features, such as the Web Apps feature in Azure App Service.
* [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.

If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter  app in App Service â€” no credit card required, and no commitments.
